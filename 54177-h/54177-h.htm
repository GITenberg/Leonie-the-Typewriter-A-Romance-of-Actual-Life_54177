<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p>The day was delicious! A warm, soft
breeze, that seemed to suggest sunny Italy,
or the luxurious indolence of far-off Japan,
tinted the atmosphere with a golden hue.</p>

<p>It rested like a halo upon the head of a
young man who sat beside a desk, idly twisting
a pen between his fingers. It was a beautiful
head! Too beautiful for a man, too
strong for a woman.</p>

<p>From the large, velvety eyes, Italian in
color and softness, but Mexican in their occasional
gleams of thrilling brilliancy, to the
clear complexion with the touch of crimson
in the cheeks; from the dainty, curly hair
that lay in tiny rings upon the broad, white
brow, to the mouth, with its sweeping, silken
mustache, the face was absolutely without
flaw or blemish. And yet no man ever
laughed at Lynde Pyne for his beauty, or
would have thought of pronouncing him effeminate.</p>

<p>"He is one of the best fellows in existence,"
they told each other at the club; "and
it is a confounded shame that he was cut out
of his uncle's will in the manner in which he
was. There was never a more honorable man
than Lynde Pyne, and for all he knows by
what means Luis Kingsley came in possession
of the money that is rightfully his, he
never says a word, but works away, early and
late, with but poor reward. It is a queer
world that robs an honest man to give his
birthright to a scoundrel."</p>

<p>But Lynde Pyne was giving little thought
to that as he sat dreamily twirling his pen on
that golden day in June.</p>

<p>His reflections were interrupted by the
entrance of his office boy.</p>

<p>"If you please, Mr. Pyne," he said respectfully,
though not servilely, "there is a young
lady here to see you."</p>

<p>Lynde glanced up slowly, evidently not
pleased at the interruption.</p>

<p>"Her name?"</p>

<p>"She is a typewriter!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Show her in."</p>

<p>He returned to his idle dreaming, but was
aroused again at the expiration of a moment.</p>

<p>"I came to see about the position you advertised,
sir," a cool, refined voice said.</p>

<p>He arose and offered her a chair, looking at
her in his own irresistible fashion.</p>

<p>And what he saw he never forgot!</p>

<p>The face was as flawless as his own. The
short, curling, red-brown hair, that looked as
though the sun had become entangled in a
shadow, the violet eyes, the graceful sweep of
the perfect chin, the exquisitely fitting gown
of cheap gray tricot, all appealed to him with
irresistible force.</p>

<p>"What machine do you operate? and what
is your record for speed?" he asked, scarcely
conscious that he had spoken at all.</p>

<p>"I use the Hammond mostly, and can
write seventy words to the minute, provided
they are not too long."</p>

<p>"You can write from dictation?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I am a stenographer and typewriter.
My last position I lost through the
death of Mr. Carl Lefevre, my employer."</p>

<p>"Then you are Miss Cuyler?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Your reputation has preceded you!" exclaimed
Lynde, with one of his most entrancing
smiles. "I shall be only too glad to engage
you. You know the duties without my
going into detail. There is only one thing
that I shall require that he did not, perhaps,
and that is, in addition to a typewriter, I wish
you to act rather as a private secretary. You
are to open all of my mail that is not marked
personal, reporting the contents to me, that I
may not be bothered with it. You think you
can do that?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not just at first, but I am so familiar
now with the work of a lawyer's office
that I don't think I would have much difficulty
in learning."</p>

<p>"That will be quite satisfactory. And the
salary?"</p>

<p>The charming face colored crimson.</p>

<p>"I know so little of business," she answered,
hesitatingly. "Of course beginning
with you is quite different from what it would
be if you were sure that I could do your
work."</p>

<p>"But I am sure! I should expect to pay
the same that Mr. Lefevre did, with a suitable
addition for the extra amount of work.
I suppose that would be reasonable?"</p>

<p>"More than I could expect."</p>

<p>"Can you begin to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. There is a whole raft of copying
in that drawer to be done. You will find
a dressing-room on that side."</p>

<p>Leonie Cuyler did not wait to be told a
second time. With a bow in Lynde's direction,
she withdrew, laying her hat and a soft
lace scarf, that had been wrapped about her
neck, upon a table.</p>

<p>She glanced carelessly into the small mirror,
endeavoring to smooth down the rebellious
curls that were one of her chief attractions.</p>

<p>For a single moment she stood gazing idly
about her, a dreamy smile upon her lips, then
shaking herself together with a little impatient
jerk, she walked into the room where
Lynde Pyne awaited her.</p>

<p>With almost tender care he showed her the
position of his papers, explained to her what
would be expected of her, then sat down,
watching the graceful movements of her
fingers as they flew lightly over the key-board.</p>

<p>He felt dizzy, as though from drinking
wine, when the evening came and he saw that
he must let her go.</p>

<p>He watched her from the room, then put
on his own hat with a weary sigh.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have not done a wise thing
to bring Leonie Cuyler here," he muttered,
"and yet what can it matter?"</p>

<p>There was something half bitter, wholly defiant
in his mental question, and he walked
from the office with anything but a pleasant
expression upon his handsome face.</p>

<p>And Leonie?</p>

<p>After her little home had been set to rights,
she sat down by the single window the room
contained, her arm resting upon the sill dejectedly.</p>

<p>An old man, aristocratic in appearance, notwithstanding
the poor clothing that he wore,
a man strangely white of hair and beard,
bent from age and sorrow, sat near her, playing
with a string that he was twining about
his fingers.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you to-night, my
darling?" he asked, breaking a long silence.
"My little one is not at all like herself! Dad
is not going to lose his sunshine at this time
of life, is he? I did not know that I should
miss the chatter of my little magpie so much.
What is the matter, Leonie?"</p>

<p>She leaned over and kissed him, but even
that was not done in her usual way.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dad!" she answered dreamily.
"That is, there is nothing wrong! I was
only thinking. That is something unusual,
I confess."</p>

<p>"Of what were you thinking?"</p>

<p>"Of a picture that I saw to-day. It was a
woman's face&mdash;a woman that I think Rembrandt
or Guido would have given half their
lives to paint. I couldn't describe it to you,
because any description would sound commonplace
applied to such an original. Her
name is Miss Evelyn Chandler."</p>

<p>When she had finished speaking she turned
her eyes slowly, and allowed them to rest
upon Godfrey Cuyler's face.</p>

<p>She was startled at the change that flashed
over it. His chin dropped, his eyes set, his
brow was covered suddenly with a moisture
that resembled death.</p>

<p>"Where did you see it?" he asked hoarsely,
his voice scarcely more than a whisper.</p>

<p>"In the private drawer of Lynde Pyne's
desk."</p>

<p>"Lynde Pyne! In Heaven's name what do
you know of him?"</p>

<p>"He is my employer."</p>

<p>"Lynde Pyne? Impossible! And you
stood by his side, looking at Evelyn Chandler's
portrait?"</p>

<p>"No. I saw it in the drawer by accident.
Her name was written beneath it. Dad, who
is Miss Evelyn Chandler, and why should I
not look at her portrait with Lynde Pyne beside
me?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you that," he gasped. "I
am pledged by an oath that I can never
break. Child, child, what miserable fate was
it that led you to Lynde Pyne's office?"</p>

<p>"Miserable fate?" she cried, rising and
standing before him. "Is it a miserable fate
that gives us bread to eat? Do you forget
that we could not have lived more than a
week longer from the savings of my little
salary? Summer is coming on now, and
lawyers do not want typewriters, or the positions
are filled. See how often I have tried
and failed. Oh, dad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" he interrupted. "If we starve,
you must not remain there! There is a reason
stronger than either life or death. Leonie, you
must listen to me!"</p>

<p>"Dad, I have no wish not to do so. There
is but one thing&mdash;I am no longer a child, and
you have no right to demand a thing of me
without explanation. If there is a reason
why I should not remain in Lynde Pyne's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
office, I am ready to go, though such a course
seems to indicate nothing short of starvation
to me, but unless you give me the reason, for
both our sakes I must decline."</p>

<p>"You don't know what you are saying!
I know your nature, your overwhelming
pride. Leonie, listen! If you refuse to hear
me now, some day you will hear a secret the
horror of which will kill you! My darling,
what am I to say? Tell me that you will
give it up?"</p>

<p>"I cannot!" she gasped, bowing her head
upon her hands. "Oh, dad, if you asked me
for the heart out of my body it would be
easier for me to give you!"</p>

<p>With a cry that resembled that of a wild
animal, Godfrey Cuyler seized the girl by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Answer me, quickly!" he cried, in a
choking voice&mdash;"you do not love Lynde
Pyne?"</p>

<p>She lifted her white face and looked at him.
It was enough!</p>

<p>The old man fell upon his knees beside her
and buried his face in her lap.</p>

<p>"My darling&mdash;my darling!" he moaned;
"how can I ever ask you to forgive me?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>A gentle breeze, like the soft current wafted
from a fan in the hands of Heaven, played
through the room in which Leonie lay sweetly
sleeping.</p>

<p>Silently the door of her room opened, and
with noiseless step the old man entered. He
looked cautiously around, then thrust forward
a candle that he had held outside the
door until he found that she was soundly
sleeping. With cat-like tread, he advanced
and stood beside her, looking down with a
countenance that was convulsed with anguish.</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling! what have I done?" he
gasped. "If I had not been so blind I might
have spared you all this. You love Lynde
Pyne! Great God! what a hideous thing life
is after all. I might have known that she
would meet them all sooner or later. It is
the law of the living. But what was I to
do? My poor little one! where is the justice
or the mercy in the curse that rests upon your
life? To know the truth, with your sensitive
nature, would kill you; yet how am I to keep
you from finding out? Oh, God! the peace
that time had brought is ended, and the bitter
agony of her life has begun! If I could but
bear it for her!"</p>

<p>He left her side after one more long look,
and taking a key that he had brought with
him he unlocked an old desk that the room
contained. Inside the drawer that opened he
pressed a spring, and took from the inner
drawer a small portrait.</p>

<p>He looked at the pictured face, then
bowed his head upon it, and the bitterest
tears of his life fell from his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lena, Lena!" he sobbed. "Can you
look down upon us now and see what your
sin is to cost her? I don't want to blame
you, my girl, now that you are dead, but
what am I to say to her? I wonder if you
can see what terrible danger threatens her,
and I wonder if you know that it would kill
her to know the sin that you committed, and
that forever ruins and blasts her life? God
forgive me! You are dead now, and perhaps
in heaven, but&mdash;Lena, Lena, Lena!"</p>

<p>He sat for some time so, then was aroused
by feeling a hand laid upon his shoulder. He
glanced up, and to his dismay, saw Leonie
standing there, her face white as death.</p>

<p>"Who is that woman?" she asked in a voice
utterly unlike her own.</p>

<p>Godfrey Cuyler hesitated, his hands shaking
until it was almost impossible for him to
hold the portrait. He thrust it into the drawer,
and locked it before she knew what he was
about.</p>

<p>"It is no one that you know!" he cried,
brokenly. "If you love me, you will not
ask."</p>

<p>She laid her hands upon his shoulders, and
held him firmly.</p>

<p>"Dad," she said, slowly, "you are keeping
something from me that you have no right to
keep. What is it? What has Miss Chandler
to do with me? And who is that woman
whose picture you have, who looks so much
like the portrait in Lynde Pyne's drawer?"</p>

<p>The old man fell into a chair, his limbs refusing
to support him.</p>

<p>She fell upon her knees beside him, clasping
his hands with both her own.</p>

<p>"Dad," she whispered hoarsely, "there is
some secret that connects my life with that
of Miss Chandler and Lynde Pyne. Tell me
what it is. If you do not, I shall find out for
myself, and it would be so much better for
me to hear it from you than from a stranger,
if it is the dreadful thing that your manner
leads me to fear. Dad, tell me."</p>

<p>"I cannot," he gasped. "You must believe
me when I tell you that there is nothing!
Nothing! Nothing! Oh, Leonie, Leonie, my
darling, put this nonsense out of your head.
If you must know the story, that is an aunt
of Miss Chandler's whom I once loved."</p>

<p>He was pointing toward the drawer where
the picture was concealed, but the girl knew
as well that he was lying to her as though the
full knowledge of the humiliating story had
been laid bare to her.</p>

<p>"Dad," she exclaimed, "oh, dad, it must
be worse even than I thought, when you will
descend to a lie! Think again, dad. What
is this hidden misery that the mere mention
of Miss Chandler's name causes you such bitter
suffering?"</p>

<p>"It is not Miss Chandler. You must not
think it!" he cried, his voice indistinct from
the chattering of his teeth. "I once swore
an oath that concerned her&mdash;that is all. I
cannot tell you, because my word is pledged.
Little one, little one, you must believe me.
You must trust dad always&mdash;always!"</p>

<p>He was trembling as though with a terrible
chill, and feeling as though her heart had
suddenly turned to ice, Leonie arose from her
knees.</p>

<p>"You are exciting yourself, dad," she said
gently, "and will be ill to-morrow. Go to
bed, will you not?"</p>

<p>"Not until you have promised me that you
will not go again to Lynde Pyne's office! I
could never rest until you had promised that.
Tell me that you will not!"</p>

<p>"I can't do that!" she cried, her voice
sounding hollow in the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>"We can't starve, and there is no other prospect&mdash;none!"</p>

<p>"Is that the only reason?"</p>

<p>She turned away wearily to avoid his penetrating
gaze.</p>

<p>"No," she answered huskily, "perhaps it
is not, but even if it were, I should still say
the same. Oh, dad, what is it? There can be
nothing so bad as this torturing suspense!
Surely you can trust me?"</p>

<p>"Leonie," he said, in a choking voice, "the
secret I know concerns Evelyn Chandler, not
yourself. You must believe me, for I speak
the truth!"</p>

<p>"Will you pledge me your honor to that,
dad?"</p>

<p>He had never told a deliberate lie in his life
before, and the effort cost him a greater
struggle than almost any one would believe,
but he controlled his countenance, and answered
slowly:</p>

<p>"I do!"</p>

<p>She allowed her hand to fall from his
shoulder, where it had rested, and sighed
wearily. He had not deceived her!</p>

<p>"Will you promise now?" he asked, almost
unable to control his eagerness.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, with a dejected shake
of the head. "If the secret does not concern
me, it would be a foolish thing for me to resign
a position that I so sorely need. Don't
ask it, dad, for there is nothing that you can
say that would induce me to do it!"</p>

<p>"Leonie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are keeping me up, dad, and I need
rest. Won't you say good-night?"</p>

<p>The voice was quiet, but the expression on
the lovely face belied it.</p>

<p>He saw what he had done, but was powerless
to alter it.</p>

<p>"Oh, child&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but she interrupted
him again.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, dad! I am tired now and&mdash;&mdash;
Go, dear, won't you? And, dad, don't worry
your dear old head about me! If there is
trouble to be borne, we can bear it together,
as we always have, but we will leave it until
it comes. You know how foolish it is to endeavor
to cross a bridge before you come to
it! Dad, dear old dad! good-night and God
bless you. Whatever may come in the future,
you have been the most faithful&mdash;- There
you are making a baby of me."</p>

<p>She placed her arms about his neck, and hid
her face upon his shoulder in a vain endeavor
to conceal her tears. She kissed him
again, then gently pushed him into his own
room, and closed the door.</p>

<p>For hours after he had gone she sat there
by the window trying to solve the mystery
that surrounded her. Her brows were knit,
her fingers tightly laced, her face pale as marble.</p>

<p>She arose suddenly, her hands clasped
above her heart, her eyes wildly bright.</p>

<p>"I have it!" she cried hoarsely. "My
mother lives! She has committed some sin
that dad fears to tell me, for which he will
never see her again, and this Evelyn Chandler
knows! Oh, mother, is it true? Is that why
he never speaks your name? If it is true,
dear, I know that you are innocent, and perhaps
I can prove it! I will try, oh, I will
try!"</p>

<p>There was no possibility of sleep that night,
and when morning broke it found her still
sitting there, forming her plans to accomplish
a thing the full knowledge of which was to
cause her the bitterest sorrow she had ever
known.</p>

<p>And in the next room, separated only by a
thin partition, Godfrey Cuyler was planning
how he could save her.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>"Ask Pyne not to keep me waiting. I am
in a great hurry!"</p>

<p>The speaker was an elderly man of unusually
fine presence, a strong cast of countenance,
and a manner that bespoke him a man
born to command, a trifle dictatorial and overbearing
perhaps, but just to the last degree,
save where his overweening pride was concerned.
He did not even glance about him,
but sat down in a preoccupied way that
would have told an observer how deeply he
was thinking.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Chandler!" Lynde exclaimed,
entering the room where he sat. "Is
not this charming weather?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I have not come to you to talk
about the weather," answered the elder man
testily. "The fact is, a most infernally unpleasant
thing has been going on at my house
for some time, and I have borne it just as
long as I can. I have come to you for your
advice."</p>

<p>He paused and looked at Lynde, but the
latter did not speak, returning the glance in
interested silence.</p>

<p>"For some time past," he continued, "I
have been missing large sums of money from
my desk. I can't understand how it can be,
unless some of the servants have a duplicate
key; but though I have set every sort of trap,
it is utterly impossible for me to catch the
thief. Last night the climax was reached!
I concluded that as the thief knew so well
the place where I kept my money, that I
would put it out of the house. Well, Pyne,
it seems that the scoundrel was compelled to
have money, for my wife's diamond bracelet
was taken. Strangely enough there were
other jewels there of much greater value, but
they were left and the bracelet taken. Mrs.
Chandler placed it in the casket with her own
hands last night after her maid had left the
room, so that we cannot think Nichette the
guilty one; but who is it? I want you to advise
me what to do!"</p>

<p>"It is a strange thing," said Pyne, musingly;
"there seems to be but one course&mdash;put
a detective to work on it."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang a detective! Do you suppose I
want my whole house carried off? That
would be the result if I put a detective on it.
They are constitutional liars, Pyne. If one of
them told me that one of the servants was
guilty, I would suspect any one in the house
sooner than the one he named. You must
suggest something different from that, or I
shall have to let them rob me in silence."</p>

<p>"But suppose I could get a woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That makes no difference. I don't believe
in professional detectives, male or female."</p>

<p>"Then I am afraid that I see no way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Pyne, but this gentleman
has expressed a dislike only for <i>professional</i>
detectives. If I can be of any assistance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
you in that way or any other, I shall be only
too pleased."</p>

<p>The words were spoken by Leonie Cuyler,
and Lynde turned and looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>"You!" he exclaimed. "What could you
do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but I should like to try to
find the thief for&mdash;this gentleman. I think
I could succeed."</p>

<p>"How should you begin?" he asked, regarding
her curiously.</p>

<p>"It would be impossible to tell, sir, until I
had seen the premises, and knew the story in
detail."</p>

<p>"But I can't spare you!" exclaimed Pyne,
by no means well pleased.</p>

<p>"It will not require all my time, sir," cried
Leonie, eagerly. "I could keep up with your
work quite as well, except, perhaps, the private
part of it; and I might get through in a
few days."</p>

<p>Lynde's astonishment over the girl's request
was infinitely greater than at Chandler's
story. Still, he readily saw that she had
some strong reason for making it and hesitated
to deny her.</p>

<p>"Let her try, Pyne," exclaimed Chandler.
"It can't make any difference, and if she has
not succeeded in a few days she can return,
and no harm done. Somehow she has inspired
me with confidence. Surely, you will be
willing to inconvenience yourself for a day or
a week for an old friend of all these years'
standing?"</p>

<p>The words were spoken in an aggrieved
tone that always brought Pyne to terms.</p>

<p>"Of course, if you make a point of it, I can
say nothing further," he answered, endeavoring
to conceal his annoyance. "When will
you want her to go?"</p>

<p>"At once. You will come as my guest,
Miss Cuyler?"</p>

<p>"I should prefer not, sir. Under those
circumstances some explanation would have
to be made to your wife and daughter. Pardon
me, sir, but all women are more or less
alike, and are liable to expose what we most
wish to conceal. If it is known that you have
a detective in the house, the thief will be on
his guard and difficult to detect. Have you
any need of an extra servant?"</p>

<p>"Yes; one of the house-maids left to-day."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, if you will give me the position
I will endeavor to fill it satisfactorily until
you can fill my place better."</p>

<p>"And you don't wish my wife or daughter
to know?"</p>

<p>"I should prefer not."</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Chandler hesitated, and Pyne supplied the
name:</p>

<p>"Cuyler."</p>

<p>"If I am to be your servant," interrupted
the girl, "you must call me Leonie!"</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure, to be sure! Can you go
now? We can concoct our story as we go."</p>

<p>"I should prefer to follow you, sir. It
might look rather suspicious if we went there
together."</p>

<p>"Right again! You will have tracked that
thief by the end of the week. If you do&mdash;well,
Leonard Chandler never forgot a service
yet."</p>

<p>Leonie colored. She was about to tell him
that what she would do would not be through
the hope of reward, and only checked herself
in time. She bowed gravely.</p>

<p>Being assured that she would follow him
without loss of time, Chandler left, and Pyne
turned eagerly to Leonie.</p>

<p>"Why were you so anxious to go there?"
he asked, making no endeavor to mask his
curiosity.</p>

<p>"I beg that you will not ask me&mdash;at least,
not yet," she answered, controlling her trembling
by a violent effort. "There are reasons
that make me desire it. If I have displeased
you I am very sorry, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg that you will not speak like that to
me, Miss Cuyler," he replied, with an impatient
wave of his hand. "If you wish it,
that is quite enough for me, but I do not
think you realize what you are doing. I
know that you are gently born and bred,
whatever misfortunes may have befallen you;
and you have forgotten what it is like to enter
a house as a servant, and the indignities to
which you will be subjected."</p>

<p>"And you forget that if any such thing occurs
I can leave upon the instant."</p>

<p>"True!"</p>

<p>"Don't try to discourage me, Mr. Pyne, I
entreat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is such an absurd thing," he interrupted
again; "I cannot bear to have you go there.
Something tells me it will not result well.
Leonie, give it up!"</p>

<p>In his earnestness he did not notice that he
had called her by her Christian name; but she
heard, and colored to the very roots of her
hair.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" she cried, in a trembling
voice. "It can do no harm, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can say nothing further, but my heart
misgives me. If it should bring trouble to
you, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned away without completing the
sentence, and with a heart that tumultuously
throbbed from a variety of emotions, Leonie
went into the next room and put on her hat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"A lady to see you, sir."</p>

<p>The door of Leonard Chandler's library was
thrown open, and Leonie Cuyler was ushered
in.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Chandler, laying aside his
paper, and looking at her curiously through
his gold-rimmed eye-glasses. "You are the
young woman I engaged as house-maid, are
you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Leonie, the throbbing
of her heart causing her to speak timidly.</p>

<p>"I thought so. Let me see. Your name
you told me is Leonie, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"This is Mrs. Chandler, my wife, and my
daughter."</p>

<p>Leonie raised her eyes to Evelyn Chandler's
face. She remembered it ever after as she
saw it then&mdash;cold and proud, but more beautiful
than any face she had ever seen before.
But as her eyes turned, after her slight bow,
a curious change came over the blonde countenance,
and Evelyn Chandler left the
room more hastily than she usually did such
things.</p>

<p>Alone in the hall, she allowed an expression
of anxiety full play. Her hands rested above
her heart, and her brows were drawn in a peculiar
frown.</p>

<p>"Leonie Cuyler!" she muttered. "What
in Heaven's name is she doing here?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>The first week passed almost without incident.</p>

<p>Leonie came and went with the freedom of
a servant, nothing that occurred escaping her
knowledge. She watched Lynde Pyne's visits
to the house with a sinking of the heart that
was indescribable. Not a thing out of the
ordinary run of fashionable life had happened.
She had discovered nothing either of
the thief or Miss Chandler's mysterious connection
with herself, and she was beginning
to think she never would.</p>

<p>It was the evening of one of Mrs. Chandler's
most pretentious dinner parties, at which
the wealth and fashion of New York had
been largely represented, and Evelyn Chandler,
in a <i>decollete</i> gown of gray <i>crepe</i> and La
France roses, had rarely appeared to greater
advantage, her sparkling wit and brilliancy of
humor making her the attraction of the evening.</p>

<p>From a distance Leonie looked on, her rebellious
heart throbbing with something very
like envy, a sentiment of which she was infinitely
ashamed, but seemed unable to control.
Lynde Pyne, too, was there, and a
short conversation had taken place between
them that had convinced her that he loved
the heiress, though he was doubtful of the
success of his suit. She had rarely if ever
been more miserable than when she saw the
last guest depart.</p>

<p>She was dragging herself wearily to her
room when a slight noise in an adjacent hall
attracted her. The subdued sound aroused
her suspicions, and slipping her slippers from
her feet she advanced silently toward it.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here again?" she
heard a voice ask in a whisper, a voice so
evidently Evelyn Chandler's that there was
no room left for doubt.</p>

<p>"I have come for money!" a man replied,
in a half dogged, wholly defiant sort of way.</p>

<p>"What, again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I must have it now!"</p>

<p>"But I have not a dollar in the world."</p>

<p>"That is not true; and if it were you could
get it easily enough, as you have done before."</p>

<p>"You told me, when I gave you the first
thousand, that that would be the last."</p>

<p>"You were not fool enough to believe it,
were you?"</p>

<p>"Well, when is it to end?"</p>

<p>"When I come in possession of a million
and can afford to live on my own money."</p>

<p>"Have you no regard for the danger to
me?"</p>

<p>"When you put it on a sentimental basis,
my dear, you might ask if I am not very tired
of living without you. In that instance I
should answer, yes. I think old Moneybags
would give you to me fast enough if he knew
as much as you and I do. Which do you prefer,
my dear?"</p>

<p>The girl shuddered, and Leonie fancied she
heard it there in the stillness.</p>

<p>"How much do you want this time?" she
asked, making no effort to conceal the dull
anger of her tone.</p>

<p>"A thousand will do."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"You always say so, but it invariably
comes when you know it must! If you can't
get the money, another diamond bracelet will
do."</p>

<p>Leonie's start almost betrayed her presence
there. Evelyn Chandler, then, the heiress
and beauty, one of the rulers of New York
society, was the thief whom she had come
there to apprehend. The thought was horrible
to her.</p>

<p>"Will this be the last?" cried Miss Chandler,
in a strained voice.</p>

<p>"Not by any means, my dear. You must
learn to save more for me out of your dress
money. I tell you what I will do. Give me
this thousand and I will be easy on you. You
can give me a stated amount, so that you can
make your arrangements to have it ready at
the beginning of each month, and I will make
no further demands upon you. Will that
do?"</p>

<p>"How much will you want?"</p>

<p>"Well, say three hundred a month!"</p>

<p>"Never! If you keep this up you will
make it impossible for me to do anything. I
will give you two hundred, and that is the
last cent."</p>

<p>"We-ll," grumbled the man hesitatingly,
"it is a beggarly amount, considering all you
have, but as I don't want to kill the goose
that lays the golden egg, I suppose I must
yield the point. Now get me the thousand
and let me go before we are discovered."</p>

<p>"There is one thing I want to say to you
first. Who do you suppose is here in this
house?"</p>

<p>"I have not an idea."</p>

<p>"Leonie Cuyler!"</p>

<p>"The devil! What is she doing here?"</p>

<p>"She is engaged as house-maid, but there
is some mystery about it that I cannot
fathom."</p>

<p>"As sure as you live that old idiot, Godfrey
Cuyler, sent her here for a purpose. If
you are smart, my girl, you will get rid of
her without loss of time."</p>

<p>"But how am I to do that?"</p>

<p>"I think I can manage it for you. It is an
infernally dangerous thing, and what is dangerous
for you is for me. I'll think about it
and write to you to-morrow. Go and get the
money now."</p>

<p>"You promise me that you will keep your
word about the two hundred in future?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I don't want to be hard on
you. You had better be in a hurry. It is
not safe for me to be in this house."</p>

<p>Knowing that it was worse than useless to
argue the matter with him, and also knowing
that he was perfectly right about his own and
her insecurity, she heaved a sigh and turned
away.</p>

<p>In the darkness her skirts touched Leonie's
in passing, but she was unconscious of it, and
flitted silently down the broad stairs, guiding
her steps by passing her fingers along the
wall.</p>

<p>Leonie followed noiselessly, scarcely daring
to draw her breath.</p>

<p>Into the library Miss Chandler went, closing
the great heavy door behind her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Leonie stood for a moment nonplused. She
could not open the door without Miss Chandler
being aware of it, and that she did not desire.</p>

<p>A sudden idea seemed to strike her, and
passing swiftly through the drawing-room,
she entered the conservatory and silently
drew back the portiere that separated it from
the library.</p>

<p>By the dim light she could see Miss Chandler
quite distinctly.</p>

<p>She had already possessed herself of a key
by some means, and was unlocking the desk
in which Leonard Chandler had told Leonie
he kept his money.</p>

<p>The beauty of the blonde face was marred
by an expression of great anxiety, but there
seemed to be not the slightest repugnance at
the disgusting act she was performing; on the
contrary, there was a smile of relief when
she found that the drawer contained an even
greater amount than she required.</p>

<p>With unusual deliberation she counted out
the money, laid it on the desk, replaced what
was left, and relocked the drawer. She
picked up the money, and was about to leave
the room, when Leonie stepped forward,
allowing the portiere to fall behind her.</p>

<p>The hand that held the money fell upon the
desk, and Miss Chandler gazed at the girl
aghast.</p>

<p>Leonie did not speak, but waited until Miss
Chandler had fully recovered herself.</p>

<p>"Why are you here at this hour?" the
heiress demanded, haughtily. "Surely you
know that the servants are not allowed to be
roaming over the house in the middle of the
night."</p>

<p>"I am not a servant, Miss Chandler," answered
Leonie, with dignity, "but a detective
whom your father placed here to locate a
thief! I am sorry to say that I have found
her."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>The tone was haughty enough, but the blue
eyes faltered, and the cheeks were white as
death.</p>

<p>"I mean," answered Leonie, firmly, "that
I shall have to report to Mr. Chandler that
the thief whom he has sworn to prosecute is
his own daughter."</p>

<p>Leonie laid her hand upon the burglar
alarm that the room contained. She had no
intention of ringing it, but was simply trying
to frighten Miss Chandler into putting the
money back, and making a promise that the
operation never should be repeated. Much
as she loathed the act, much as she despised
the girl who could descend to so vile a thing,
she had no wish to disgrace her or the family
of which she was a member.</p>

<p>But she was unprepared for what occurred.</p>

<p>With a spring like that of a tigress, Evelyn
Chandler was upon her, and had seized her
hand.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you are doing?" she
cried, hoarsely. "You would disgrace me
forever! I tell you that you shall not. Let
go of that bell, or as Heaven is my witness I
will kill you, and escape before it can be answered!"</p>

<p>By the flash of demoniacal light in the blue
eyes, Leonie saw that the girl meant what
she said. Her hand fell from the bell-cord.</p>

<p>"Then put the money back," she said, as
quietly as she could force herself to speak.</p>

<p>"Never!" exclaimed Miss Chandler, vehemently.
"Do you think my father would
believe you if you told this story to him, and
I was not here? To-morrow you may tell
him what you wish."</p>

<p>"Then you propose to make me an accomplice
to your act, so to speak, by my remaining
quiet, and saying nothing, while you rob
your own father, is that it?" cried Leonie,
aghast at the girl's audacity.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" replied Miss Chandler, firmly,
the memory of her danger overcoming her
fear.</p>

<p>"And I tell you," exclaimed Leonie with
equal firmness, "that it shall not be so! Put
that money back, refuse in my presence to
give that man up-stairs any more, either now,
or at any future time, and you are safe from
me. Refuse, and as God is my judge I will
denounce you! You think I am at your
mercy. Look!"</p>

<p>She had prepared for some such emergency,
little thinking under what circumstances she
would require it; and as she spoke she produced
a small Derringer revolver, which she
did not point toward Miss Chandler, but with
it clasped in one hand she calmly laid the
other upon the bell-cord.</p>

<p>"Will you put that money back?" she
asked, coolly.</p>

<p>"No!" cried Miss Chandler, half wildly.
"Denounce me if you will; disgrace me, if
you wish. Do you not think I will not
tell the story of your infamous birth? Do
you think that I have not seen that you are
in love with Lynde Pyne? Ha, ha! Tell this
if you wish. It will disgrace me, and then I
shall not hesitate to tell the world that you
are the daughter of Lena Mauprat, who was
condemned to the penitentiary for stealing.
What if I am the daughter of the same
mother, and but the adopted child of Leonard
Chandler? I am legitimate, while you are
not!"</p>

<p>Slowly the hand that held the bell-cord
dropped. The one that held the pistol relaxed
its hold, and the weapon fell upon the chair
that was under it noiselessly, the dainty face
became gray and drawn, and without a cry
or moan, Leonie Cuyler fell at her sister's
feet.</p>

<p>Godfrey Cuyler's terrible suffering was explained
at last.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>A pale gray light, like a stray moonbeam
glimmering upon the headstone of a grave,
crept into the room and softly touched the
face of the girl that lay upon the floor in a
death-like swoon.</p>

<p>There is an inexplicable something in magnetism
that annihilates distance and speaks
louder than a human voice.</p>

<p>It has baffled scientists for generations, and
will for generations more, yet its presence has
been more or less felt by every one, like the
influence of a haunting but half-forgotten
dream.</p>

<p>Some such feeling disturbed the slumbers
of Leonard Chandler. He tried vainly to
sleep, and at last, in sheer desperation, he
arose, slipped on his trousers, slippers, and
dressing-gown, and sat down to that consoler
of man&mdash;a smoke.</p>

<p>It had not, however, its usual influence.
His nervousness increased with each moment,
until at last he sprung to his feet, the expression
of his countenance indicating great
anxiety.</p>

<p>"It is the same feeling that I had while I
was being robbed the last time," he muttered.
"I wonder if it can mean anything?
I am going down to the library and sleep
there on the couch to-night. No one will
know of my presence there, and it may be
that I shall detect the thief myself. Pshaw!
It seems too absurd an idea to think of&mdash;and
yet it can do no harm. How Anna and Evelyn
would laugh if they knew of this!"</p>

<p>He hesitated, puffing out great volumes of
smoke in his perplexity, then turned resolutely
toward the door.</p>

<p>"They will have to laugh," he exclaimed
aloud, compressing his lips firmly. "Something
tells me to go, and I must go!"</p>

<p>He waited no longer, but opening the door
softly, he went noiselessly down the stairs,
and silently opening the door of the library,
passed in.</p>

<p>He advanced nearer to the desk, and, with
a thrill of horror, saw the revolver lying upon
a chair. He leaned over to pick it up, and as
he did so his eyes fell upon the colorless face
of the girl lying there.</p>

<p>He shrunk backward with a suppressed
cry, then quickly kneeled beside her and
placed his hand above her heart. It was slowly
trembling.</p>

<p>Rising hastily, he rung the bell violently.</p>

<p>The sound clanged through the silent house
like the iteration of the cry of murder on the
stilly night. It did not cease until servants
and family had hurriedly entered the room,
their faces blanched with fear.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Mrs. Chandler, her
countenance white as Leonie's own.</p>

<p>"Heaven knows!" answered Chandler hastily,
his brow contracted curiously. "Look
there! There is some mystery about this
house. I think we are about to get at the
bottom of it."</p>

<p>He pointed, as he spoke to the prostrate
body upon the floor, then lifted it himself to
a couch.</p>

<p>"Some of you do what you can to restore
her," he ordered shortly.</p>

<p>While the servants were obeying he took
his keys from his pocket, and with a hand
that had grown steady under excitement, he
opened the drawer that had contained his
money.</p>

<p>He quickly found the roll, brought home
the night before to meet an obligation the
following morning at nine o'clock, and counted
it.</p>

<p>Exactly one thousand dollars gone!</p>

<p>He picked up the pistol and looked at it
carefully. Every chamber was full.</p>

<p>With compressed lips and a countenance of
dangerous resolution he laid it down, and
turned toward Leonie again. The first person
to confront him was his daughter.</p>

<p>"More money missing?" she asked, with a
show of anxious interest, yet capitally assumed
innocence.</p>

<p>"A thousand!" he answered, almost shortly.
"There is one consolation in it. I shall
soon know the thief! I would give a thousand,
or even ten, to know that!"</p>

<p>He left her and, stepping to the side of
the couch, he stood with folded arms awaiting
Leonie's restoration to consciousness. He
neither spoke nor moved, but stood like a
statue through the moments that seemed like
hours until the eyes opened, and with an air
of great bewilderment Leonie sat up.</p>

<p>With the fingers of one hand pressed upon
her temple, Leonie slowly arose from her reclining
position, her eyes traveling from one
place to another vaguely. They rested at
last upon the blonde beauty that had ruled
New York society with an iron hand, and with
a long breath, that was a half articulated
sound, she tottered to her feet.</p>

<p>Evelyn Chandler's heart gave a great bound,
then seemed to stand dangerously still.</p>

<p>Leonard Chandler was perplexed beyond
expression.</p>

<p>"Leonie," he said calmly, "you were in
this room when it was robbed, were you
not?"</p>

<p>She nodded without speaking.</p>

<p>"Who did it?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, her eyes still upon his face.</p>

<p>"Why do you not answer?" he asked, almost
roughly.</p>

<p>"I cannot!" she replied, so hoarsely that no
one would have recognized her voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Chandler was rigid as marble.</p>

<p>"Do you realize," he said, impressively,
"that your refusal leaves a shadow upon
some member of my family?"</p>

<p>"That cannot be," Leonie answered with
painful effort. "What need would any member
of your family have to steal?"</p>

<p>"It was some one out of the house, then?"</p>

<p>"It was some one&mdash;out of the house!"</p>

<p>The pause was so long before the most important
word, that when it was spoken
Evelyn Chandler almost betrayed herself by
a sigh of relief. She knew that her secret
was safe, yet there was nothing of gratitude
in her feeling toward Leonie. On the contrary,
she detested her all the more that she
owed it to her.</p>

<p>Behind her relief the sound of the voice of
the man who had adopted her came to Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Do you know that your refusal to convict
a thief under the circumstances makes you an
accessory to his crime, and punishable with
him?" he was saying, his eyes steely with
anger.</p>

<p>The violet eyes never faltered.</p>

<p>"I beg that you will not do that sir, for&mdash;my&mdash;father's
sake. He is old and&mdash;has but&mdash;me.
Surely you will not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shall go to jail if you persist in your
refusal to answer me!" cried Chandler, without
the softening of a muscle in his face. "I
will give you until morning to decide."</p>

<p>"It will be useless, I cannot alter my determination.
But&mdash;is there nothing that you
can say? Surely you will pray him only to
let me go free?"</p>

<p>She had turned to Evelyn Chandler and extended
her arms. The lovely face was quivering
with anguish, the eyes glistened with a
fire that no tears could quench, the sweet
mouth trembled piteously, but Miss Chandler
returned the glance with one that was half
sneering, wholly defiant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never interfere in any of my father's
matters," she said, coldly: "he is quite right.
If you know the thief, you should be forced
to tell who it is."</p>

<p>Too dumb from anguish to realize the extreme
audacity of the girl who could stand
before her and so coolly make a speech like
that, yet seeing that she had nothing to hope
for in that quarter, Leonie turned away with
a weary groan.</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to say," she exclaimed,
dully. "I pray that you will spare
me for my father's sake. Oh, dad, dad! you
tried to save me from this but I would not
let you. God help you and me!"</p>

<p>Regardless of their presence, or perhaps
forgetful of it, the unhappy girl sunk upon
the floor, and covering her white face with
her hands rocked her body to and fro miserably.</p>

<p>Twice Leonard Chandler spoke to her, but
she did not hear; then motioning the others
from the room, he, too, passed out, and turning
the key in the lock upon the outside, he
left her there a prisoner.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>The house had barely become quiet again
than a noiseless step descended the stairs, a
light hand turned the key in the door of the
library, and Evelyn Chandler once more entered
the presence of her sister.</p>

<p>"I have risked my father's displeasure to
give you your liberty," said Miss Chandler,
coldly. "If you are wise, you will leave
here at once and forever. My father is a man
whose justice is not tempered with mercy.
I tell you frankly that if he can find you he
will most certainly punish you as he has
threatened to do."</p>

<p>"You mean that you would allow him to do
that?" Leonie asked, her voice still unsteady
almost to inarticulation.</p>

<p>"What have I to do with it?" asked Miss
Chandler, with calm scorn. "I am not one
of the emotional kind to become interested in
criminals."</p>

<p>"And is that all that you have to say to
me?"</p>

<p>"All? What more would you have me
say?"</p>

<p>"At least that you are sorry."</p>

<p>"I repeat that I am not of a sentimental
nature. I will say, however, that I am sorry
you forced this story from me."</p>

<p>"Not for what you have done? Oh, my
sister&mdash;for you are my sister&mdash;listen to me. I
don't know what that man is to you, but I beg
of you, for your own sake, not to do again the
dreadful thing you have done to-night. Think
of the consequences!"</p>

<p>A hard, cruel, sneering laugh rippled quietly
through the elder girl's lips.</p>

<p>"Fancy the daughter of Lena Mauprat
preaching honesty!" she exclaimed, with
heartless sarcasm. "My dear, are you anxious
to know who that man was who forced
me to produce that money for him? Well,
since I have seen how perfectly I can trust
you, I don't mind telling you that he is my
father, your mother's husband, an ex-convict,
a gambler, and presumably a thief. I am
very anxious that his relationship to me
should not be known to my respected adopted
father, who knows nothing whatever of my
parentage, save that they were poor. I am
expecting to make a brilliant marriage, thanks
to my prospective millions, and I cannot
afford to spoil it with any romantic stories of
convict fathers and mothers. You are sensible
enough to understand that, I am quite
sure, and will do nothing to spoil your sister's
chances. Am I not correct?"</p>

<p>The speech was so heartless, so utterly
cold-blooded, that Leonie, even in her half-stunned
condition, shuddered.</p>

<p>"You have nothing to fear from me!" she
answered wearily. "I don't seem to realize
just yet what has happened, but as I have
been in ignorance of your existence until to-night,
I can try to forget, if you so wish! Is
there nothing kind that you can say to me,
for our&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had meant to say, "for our mother's
sake," but the words stuck in her throat and
refused to be uttered.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler laughed again.</p>

<p>"Why did not you finish your sentence?"
she asked brutally. "If you will take my
advice, my dear Leonie, you will leave here
at once. I cannot answer for the result if you
remain until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"At least you will say good-bye?"</p>

<p>"With all the pleasure in life!"</p>

<p>Weary, heart-sore, Leonie turned away.
There was nothing that she could say&mdash;nothing
that she could do.</p>

<p>Bowed down, feeling as though a century
had been added to her years since the night
before, she crept away, and out to where the
pale streaks of red in a cool gray sky showed
that the morning had broken.</p>

<p>She was without hat or wrap, but did not
seem to realize it as she tottered on, apparently
oblivious of surroundings, even of suffering!</p>

<p>And so she reached the house that had been
her happy home! How changed everything
seemed! Slowly, wearily she ascended the
stairs and entered the room where she and
"dad" had passed so many pleasant hours.</p>

<p>As she opened the door she saw that the
room was not empty.</p>

<p>In a large chair near the open window Godfrey
Cuyler sat, his long white hair slightly
lifted by the breeze, his head resting upon
the back of the chair, his eyes closed in sleep.</p>

<p>She stood above him, gazing silently down
upon him, trying to think while her brain
seemed to be an impenetrable maze, yet
through all the gloom that surrounded her a
single thought struggled through! How white
and wan he looked! Was she about to lose
him in addition to the other terrible trouble
that had come upon her?</p>

<p>As the thought came to her, a low groan of
indescribable misery fell from her lips. It
awakened the sleeper.</p>

<p>His eyes opened, and with a start he
straightened himself in his chair.</p>

<p>"You, Leonie!" he gasped. "In Heaven's
name, what has happened?"</p>

<p>She kneeled beside him and laid her lips
upon his hand without answering.</p>

<p>The act frightened him as perhaps no other
would. He fell back, his face became ashen,
his lips blue. A cold moisture, like the dew
of death, stood thickly upon his brow.</p>

<p>"Leonie," he said, his voice sounding
strangely thick and guttural, "where have
you been for the past week that you could
not tell dad?"</p>

<p>She lifted her white, anguished face and
allowed her eyes to rest upon his.</p>

<p>"I have been with Leonard Chandler!" she
answered dully.</p>

<p>Why he did not die at that moment was a
mystery, but the shock seemed to rather
paralyze than excite him. His lips grew a
shade bluer and trembled, but that was the
only evidence of emotion.</p>

<p>"And you know all?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Not all, but, oh, dad, I know I am the
daughter of a thief, and it is enough, enough.
Dad, dad, why did you do it?"</p>

<p>The misery of the young voice would have
been exquisite torture to him had he not been
deprived of the capacity of feeling. His
brain seemed to act in a way, yet his emotional
organs were stunned. He took her by
the shoulders and looked her earnestly in the
eyes.</p>

<p>"My darling," he murmured, his voice
scarcely audible, "do you think I brought
that shame into your life? Your mother was
my daughter, my dearest! Oh, Leonie,
Leonie, I have tried so hard to keep this
hideous thing from you, for this&mdash;for this!
Child, child, why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"It is better so, dad, much better! It has
shown me what my life must be, and my&mdash;dreams&mdash;were&mdash;different.
Somehow I feel
better to know that you are not my father,
that you did not bring this shame upon me!
Oh, dad, why can we not die together and
end it all?"</p>

<p>A curious expression crept over the white,
still face of the old man, but he made no
comment, only smoothed down the bright,
beautiful hair with a hand that trembled
peculiarly.</p>

<p>"Now that you know so much, my little
one, I must tell you all," he stammered, wearily.</p>

<p>He tried to rise, but the effort it cost was
beyond his strength.</p>

<p>"Look in the desk there and get me the
picture you saw," he whispered, handing her
a key.</p>

<p>Mechanically she obeyed, and handed it to
him with the case unopened. He pressed the
spring and revealed the pictured face to her.</p>

<p>"It was your mother," he said, almost reverently.</p>

<p>She took the portrait from his hand and
gazed upon it. For the first time the glazed
eyes filled with tears, but they did not fall.</p>

<p>"It is very like&mdash;her," she said, slowly.
"Oh, dad! what have I done that God should
send a curse like this upon me?"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear! You must not question the
wisdom of God. Bear your burden meekly,
and He will help you in the end. Oh, Leonie!
why would not you let me save you?"</p>

<p>"I could not, dad. You must not blame
me. What right had I, the daughter of a
thief&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shall not say that&mdash;she was your
mother! Listen to her story, and see if you
cannot find an excuse for her, even as I did.
Listen, Leonie! I will make the story as short
as I can."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>Godfrey Cuyler paused.</p>

<p>His face was growing more gray momentarily,
his breathing seemed forced and unnatural,
there was a curious, quick throb
about his heart that was ominous, but Leonie
did not observe it in her bewildered state.
She might have noticed that he was pale, but
she attached no significance to it.</p>

<p>When he could control himself sufficiently,
he began his story.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to tell you what Lena
was to me in her childhood," he said, brokenly.
"Her mother died when she was a little
child, and I had only her. Ah, Leonie, I
worshiped her! We were wealthy then, and
there was never a desire of hers that I left ungratified.
I devoted my life to her&mdash;watching
her grow as a miser does his fortune. She
was my idol, and God punished me, as He
promised to do all those who worshiped outside
of Himself. She was only eighteen&mdash;young,
lovely; oh! I can never describe her to
you as she was when she met Ben Mauprat.
She could have married a prince, but she fell
in love with that scoundrel, and while I
pleaded with her upon bended knee to give
him up, she eloped with him as soon as my
back was turned, and the tragedy of her life
began. He was a gambler, a libertine&mdash;there
was nothing under heaven that was low and
vile that he was not. To save him from the
penitentiary I spent money&mdash;thousand after
thousand, until I had reduced myself almost
to beggary&mdash;and the end came! When he
could get no more money from me he robbed
a bank, was detected, and sentenced to the
penitentiary for ten years."</p>

<p>There was a long pause for rest, then, with
only an increased pallor in the face, Godfrey
Cuyler continued:</p>

<p>"At that time I was living in New Orleans,
but that city, being too small for Ben Mauprat,
he brought his wife to New York. Evelyn
was then about three years of age, and as
like her in appearance as could be. When Ben
was sent to the penitentiary my poor girl
wrote to me, but the letter never reached me.
That was the cause of all the after suffering.
She thought that I had deserted her, and that
made her reckless. Oh, Lena, Lena! You
should have known me better, my darling!"</p>

<p>For the first time emotion overcame him,
and bowing his head upon his hand, the old
man sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>A choking sensation followed. He gasped
once or twice for breath, then in a much
more feeble and broken voice, he continued:</p>

<p>"She was penniless, helpless, and had that
child to support. Well, Leonie, the result of
it was that Mrs. Chandler, in her charity
rounds, saw the child, fell in love with it, and
convinced by Lena of the perfect respectability
of the child's parentage, she adopted it.
She knew nothing of the baby's father, but
believed him to be dead. How can I tell you
the rest?"</p>

<p>The white lips trembled. He endeavored
to moisten them, but his tongue seemed as
dry and parched as the lips. Still by a mighty
effort he went on:</p>

<p>"Lena went to live with a family of decent
surroundings, though poor. She had a little
room in the house, and took in sewing enough
to support herself; but it was a terrible existence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
one day having bread, the next day
none, haunted continually by the fear of
starvation. Well, at last Satan succeeded in
accomplishing her utter destruction. So
small a matter as the water-works in the
house where she lived, almost upon the charity
of the people, got out of order. The owner
of the house came himself to see what repairs
were necessary. He saw Lena. I have told
you that she was beautiful. Leonie, he fell
in love with her. Then the temptation of her
life began. They told her how rich and proud
he was, that there was scarcely a family in
the city who could compare with his in point
of birth and wealth, but that pride was his
fault. Darling, that man was Roger Pyne!"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>That name had power to arouse Leonie
from a lethargy as none other had.</p>

<p>She sprung to her feet, but as she caught
sight of Godfrey Cuyler's face, she sunk back
again with a low sob of anguish.</p>

<p>"He was the uncle of the man who was your
employer," he continued, the effort to speak
growing more painful with each moment.
"He fell in love with her. Believing that
poverty was the only disgrace that attached
to her, Roger Pyne called upon her and proposed
marriage. Leonie, she was starving.
She was so bitterly alone, so helpless, there
was none near to guide her in the right path,
every hope had been taken out of her life&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
what shall I say to make you see her
fault in a merciful light? God knows how
hard it is to resist a temptation like that!
She knew that if he knew the story of her
life he would never marry her, and to her the
protection he offered meant heaven. Leonie,
Leonie, she married him, never telling him
the history of her life, or that she had a living
husband in the penitentiary!"</p>

<p>"My God!"</p>

<p>The exclamation fell like ice from the cold
lips, but the expression of Leonie's face did not
alter.</p>

<p>"A week later he discovered all," the old
man went on dully. "In his terrible anger
he cast her off without a penny; he went to
Europe and left her here to starve. For several
months she lived the same way that she
had done before, barely keeping soul and
body together; then you were born! I can
never tell you what it was after that. Mrs.
Chandler was also in Europe. Lena wrote to
me many times, but the letters never reached
me, and at last starvation came! She saw
you dying before her very eyes, dying for
want of food, and she unable to help you.</p>

<p>"Made desperate by her terrible extremity,
she rushed out into the street and snatched a
purse from a man. It contained only twenty
little pitiful dollars, not one of which she had
used; but she was arrested, tried, as her husband
had been, and&mdash;God! how can I say it?&mdash;was
convicted. I read the story in the
papers. How I ever lived to reach her is
more than I can tell. There were no extenuating
circumstances printed, she was
poor and friendless. There was no mention
made of her marriage to Roger Pyne, but
only the cold story of her crime. Oh, Leonie,
my child&mdash;&mdash; But what is the use in attempting
to tell you what I suffered? No words
could ever describe it. I reached her in time
to see her die, to hear her story, to have you
confided to my care, and that was all. She
died in the Tombs prison. It took all the
soul out of my body, but I knew that I must
live for your sake. I could not go back again
to my old home, where everything reminded
me of her, and so I settled here in this great
city, where no man knows his neighbors'
business or cares to know. As I watched you
grow, the same love that I had given to
Lena I felt for you. Then the desire that
grew to mania came that you might never
know of the shadow upon your birth. Oh,
how I prayed that you might be spared that;
and now&mdash;Leonie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was another gasp for breath, a wild
clutching at the collar, and for the first time
Leonie saw. She sprung to her feet and seized
his hand wildly.</p>

<p>"Dad," she gasped&mdash;"dad! in Heaven's
name what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he answered, his throat closing
over the word with a peculiar choking. "You
must&mdash;not be&mdash;frightened. I&mdash;am&mdash;often&mdash;so."</p>

<p>"Not like that. Oh, God, dad! it looks like&mdash;death!"</p>

<p>His face was not more ghastly than her
own. She had forgotten the terrible secret
of her birth, forgotten her mother's suffering,
forgotten everything save the danger that
was menacing him.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he whispered, the sound a feeble
effort. "My little one, my little one&mdash;you do&mdash;not&mdash;blame
dad?"</p>

<p>"Blame you? Oh, my darling, my darling!
what does life contain for me but you? Dad,
dad! look at me. Tell me that you will not
leave me. Dad, speak to me."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;will of&mdash;God&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely God will not take you from me
when you are all I have! Let me go for a
doctor, quick."</p>

<p>"No; I should die alone while you were
gone. I knew&mdash;the end&mdash;was near before&mdash;you
came&mdash;and I prayed&mdash;God&mdash;to send&mdash;you
before&mdash;it was&mdash;too late. He heard&mdash;my
prayer&mdash;I am&mdash;grate&mdash;ful. Darling&mdash;it has
come. It is&mdash;&mdash; Good-bye forever now!"</p>

<p>"Oh dad, dad, dad! take me with you. I
cannot remain here so bitterly alone with
this hideous disgrace, this frightful secret
bearing me down. Let me go, too."</p>

<p>She leaped to her feet wildly, unmistakable
insanity glittering in her eyes, and seized
a knife that lay upon the table.</p>

<p>Godfrey Cuyler lifted his half glazed eyes
and looked at her. Although death was upon
him he realized her intention. Struggling to
his feet he caught the back of his chair with
one hand, and with the other he grasped the
knife.</p>

<p>God lent him strength for the moment; he
wrenched the knife from her and flung it
from him. It fell through the open window.</p>

<p>She pitched headlong upon the floor insensible.
He fought back death to lean above
her, but a spasm of the heart seized him. He
flung himself around and fell back into his
chair. The muscles relaxed after a moment,
the eyes rolled upward, and limp, utterly lifeless,
the body of Godfrey Cuyler lay, when
they found him there an hour later, with
Leonie still upon the floor at his feet.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>It was the girl whom Leonie had engaged
to cook Godfrey Cuyler's meals during her
sojourn at Leonard Chandler's who found
them there.</p>

<p>She gave the alarm, and several women,
and men, as well, hastily answered the summons.</p>

<p>Little was known of the Cuylers among
the tenants of the house, as they were people
who had few associates, but a doctor was
brought, and the living separated from the
dead.</p>

<p>He it was who examined some of their
effects, and finding only the address of Lynde
Pyne, sent a messenger to his office.</p>

<p>He was not in so early in the morning, and
it was not until nearly ten o'clock that the
note the physician had sent reached him.</p>

<p>He did not even remove his coat and hat,
but turning to his office boy, gave a hasty
order:</p>

<p>"If any one calls, say that I will return by
noon, if not earlier."</p>

<p>"But, sir, Mr. Chandler has been here already.
He seemed very much put out that
you were not here, and said that he would
call again at half-past ten."</p>

<p>For a moment Lynde stood gnawing the
ends of his mustache in perplexity, then, with
an impatient wave of the hand, he turned
away.</p>

<p>"Say that I could not wait, but that I will
call at his office at one," he exclaimed, leaving
the room almost at once.</p>

<p>Once in the street, he called a cab, and giving
the driver the address the physician had
provided, he ordered him to drive quickly.</p>

<p>It was with feelings of decided relief that
he sprung from the cab as it paused before
the door of a poor but respectable lodging-house.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the door of Leonie's
room opened to admit him. She had recovered
from her swoon, but lay almost lifeless
upon the chair in which her grandfather had
died.</p>

<p>In as few words as possible the physician
explained what had occurred, after Lynde had
introduced himself, and at the latter's request
he was left alone with Leonie.</p>

<p>She was not even cognizant of his presence
when he drew a chair to her side and took
her hand.</p>

<p>She drew back when she recognized him,
as though another terrible misfortune had befallen
her.</p>

<p>"You!" she whispered. "How came you
here?"</p>

<p>"They told me you were in trouble and I
came at once," he answered tenderly. "My
poor little girl, is there nothing that I can do
for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing! nothing, but to leave me alone!
That is all, that is all!"</p>

<p>She shivered horribly and arose, pacing up
and down the floor, her great wild eyes restlessly
roving from one object to another.</p>

<p>He watched her for a few moments, fascinated
by the peculiar magnetism of her sufferings,
then arose, and laying his arm about
her shoulders, he took her hand. There was
nothing impertinent in his act, only the sincere
interest of one whose heart is deeply
touched.</p>

<p>"Leonie," he said, gently, "let me do
something to help you bear your terrible sorrow.
It breaks my heart to see you like this
while I sit helplessly by. You must not
grieve so. They tell me he was old. Think,
dear! He has borne his burden of life, and
perhaps now is happy and at peace with God.
You could not expect to keep him with you
always. Are you not a little selfish, dear?
Try to think of it as the will of God, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't!" she interrupted, her teeth
chattering under her fearful suffering; "he
was all on earth I had. In the whole world
there is no human being left for me. I am
as much alone as though my little craft rocked
in mid-ocean with only the waves surrounding
me. Oh, God! You cannot think
what that means until you have been left so.
I have nothing left me but suffering and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had meant to say disgrace, but the
word was drowned in a horrible groan. She
fell into a chair, and holding to the back
buried her face upon her arm. Lynde Pyne
stood beside her. He laid his hand upon her
bowed head, and smoothed the soft hair
caressingly.</p>

<p>The expression of his face was one of keenest
pain.</p>

<p>"Leonie," he said, pausing between each
word as though to control an almost irresistible
desire, "you must not speak with
such despair. You are not&mdash;alone. If a
steadfast friendship&mdash;the love of a&mdash;brother&mdash;will
be a consolation to you, I offer you myself.
Leonie, little girl, trust me."</p>

<p>"Trust you?" she echoed; "with my whole
heart. Ah! what am I saying? Forget it!
I&mdash;I am weak&mdash;too miserable to think. Mr.
Pyne, if you have any pity for me, I beg that
you will go away. I cannot&mdash;come to&mdash;you
again to do the work&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't speak of that now. What do I care
for the work or anything else, when you are
in trouble like this? Leonie, don't look like
that! Oh, child! if I might only bear it for
you. You must not send me away, dear!
There is so much to be done, and I must do
it for you. Have you no woman friend?"</p>

<p>"No. Dad and I have lived all alone, caring
only for each other. Oh, dad! why did
you leave me with this frightful burden to
bear alone? Why could you not take me with
you? I feel as if I were going mad."</p>

<p>"Hush, dear! There are others to whom
you are necessary. Leonie, I must tell you,
great sin though I am committing in doing so.
My darling, I love you with all the soul in my
body, with all the strength of my being. Can
you not see it? Do you not know it? Leonie,
what have I said to cause you to look at me
like that?"</p>

<p>"You love me?" she whispered, the words
more a breath than an articulation&mdash;"you
love me?"</p>

<p>"Dearest, can you doubt it? I know that
I am the greatest scoundrel living, to tell you
so. But how can I see you in such distress
and not speak, when my heart is full to overflowing?
Darling, look at me."</p>

<p>She had buried her face in her hands, and
was rocking herself to and fro in her abandonment
to a grief that was well nigh killing
her. At his command she dropped her hands
exposing to him an expression of agony that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
he had never seen equaled. With a suppressed
cry he took her in his arms and
covered her lips with passionate kisses.</p>

<p>"My love, my love, you madden me!" he
whispered. "What terrible shadow is it that
is darkening your life? You love me! I see
it in the expression of your sweet, sad eyes,
and yet the knowledge of my love brings you
but pain. Leonie, what is it?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," she cried hoarsely.
"I entreat you to leave me! I will tell you
that there is a shadow upon my life, the
knowledge of which reached me within the
last few hours, that has forever wrecked my
happiness. There is no relief that can ever
come to me but death! If I love you, it but
makes the curse the greater, and the assurance
of reciprocation is anguish!"</p>

<p>"You love me, then? Tell me but that!"</p>

<p>"Love you!"</p>

<p>She crushed his hand beneath hers and
arose, staggering as though beneath the
weight of a physical burden. He sprung to
his feet and took her by the shoulders, his
beautiful face quivering with emotion.</p>

<p>"You are tempting me to the first dishonorable
act of my life," he cried, almost
fiercely. "I love you as no man ever loved
a woman before. My whole soul seems swallowed
up in my passion! I am the betrothed
husband of another woman, but you have
but to speak the word to make me false to my
promise! I will give up everything for you,
even to life itself were that necessary. I care
not what shadow darkens your existence.
Say but the word, promise that you will be
my wife, and I will throw aside every consideration
for your sake! Leonie, speak to
me!"</p>

<p>His passion seemed to quiet her. Not since
her entrance to the library, where she had
discovered something of that fearful secret,
had she been so calm. She did not attempt
to withdraw herself from him, but gazed into
his face with a devotion he never forgot.</p>

<p>"I thank you for your words," she said
brokenly. "Perhaps they have saved me
from suicide or a madhouse. I think I have
suffered this day as no woman ever did before,
yet I would go through it all again before
I would have you false to your vow.
There are reasons why, even if no pledge existed,
you could never make me your wife. I
tell you this because it may be a comfort to
you in the after years. It is good-bye now
forever, for from this hour to see each other
would be dishonor."</p>

<p>"And you can speak of it so calmly?"</p>

<p>"I can, because my heart is broken."</p>

<p>"And you think that I will give you up,
knowing that you love me? Never! I will go
to Miss Chandler and tell her the truth. I
will say to her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!"</p>

<p>The interruption came from Leonie.</p>

<p>She had wrenched herself from his arms,
and was standing gazing into his face in an
almost stupid way, her eyes expressive of
paralyzing horror. She was bending slightly
forward, her lips parted, her countenance
drawn to distortion.</p>

<p>"You are betrothed to Evelyn Chandler?"
she asked, in a strained undertone.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"My God!"</p>

<p>She lifted her hand to her brow as though
to clear her brain.</p>

<p>What was she to do? The situation was
hideous to her, and yet she felt herself utterly
incapable of revealing the story of her own
life and her sister's. But could she in justice
allow an innocent man to marry a thief, the
daughter of a convict, when she could save
him?</p>

<p>To speak would ruin her sister, throw her
upon the world as a beggar to fall to the lowest
depths of infamy, as Leonie knew she
would. To remain silent would very likely
result in the ruin of the man she loved.</p>

<p>As she stood revolving the terrible alternative
in her mind the door opened, and a blue-coated
officer entered the room.</p>

<p>"Are you Leonie Cuyler?" he asked, standing
before the shrinking girl.</p>

<p>"I am," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Then you are my prisoner!"</p>

<p>He laid his hand roughly upon her shoulder
and turned her toward the door.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>The horror of the situation struck Lynde
Pyne with paralyzing force, but his was one
of those natures that recovers all the more
quickly, the more powerful the blow.</p>

<p>With instinctive kindness he drew the girl's
arm through his own, and by his strength
steadied her tottering feet.</p>

<p>"Lead the way!" he said to the officer.
"We will follow you."</p>

<p>He turned to Leonie, all his heart seeming
to glow through his eyes.</p>

<p>"Do not fear," he whispered. "I will save
you. My poor girl, my suffering one, you
must trust me, and know that your sorrows
are mine. I will bring you back here within
the hour. You trust me, do you not?"</p>

<p>She was too much dazed to reply. All intellectuality
seemed frozen in her. She was
scarcely conscious of what he had been speaking.</p>

<p>He hurried her onward that he might return
with her all the sooner, drawing her
arm yet closer within his own protectingly.</p>

<p>Once upon the street, he called a carriage,
and together with the officer, they entered
it.</p>

<p>He spoke but once to her on the way to the
station-house, and then she did not reply. He
attempted no further conversation, but
watched her fearfully, noting with horror the
stoniness of her countenance.</p>

<p>She seemed to be unconscious of her surroundings
when she was placed in the narrow
cell, and when they came to her again some
time later, they found her in the exact position
in which she had been left. Not a muscle
seemed to have been disturbed.</p>

<p>Lynde Pyne entered there with an officer.
He took her by the hand, and gently lifted
her to her feet.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, gently, "we will return
to your home again."</p>

<p>Some intelligence struggled to her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am no longer a prisoner, then?" she
asked, dully.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Will you explain it to me?"</p>

<p>"There is so very little to explain! When
we get home&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, now! You need not be afraid to tell
me the worst. If anything could have killed
me or driven me mad, I should be dead to
this suffering now. Has&mdash;that man withdrawn
the charge he made against me?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o!" stammered Pyne.</p>

<p>"I see! You forget that my experience
has been in the office of a lawyer. How
much bail was required?"</p>

<p>The interrogation was put to the officer,
and not to Pyne.</p>

<p>Disregarding, or not seeing the glance of
warning from the latter, he answered with
the customary indifference of his class:</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred."</p>

<p>Leonie groaned. Something in her face
sent a quick thrill of apprehension through
Pyne, but as she fell back immediately into
the old apathy, he said nothing.</p>

<p>Silently he led her to the waiting carriage,
and they were driven again to that house
wherein death reigned. Wearily Leonie
dragged herself up the long, steep flight and
into the room where she had only that morning&mdash;but
how long ago it seemed&mdash;heard the
hideous story of her mother's shame.</p>

<p>She started to the room in which lay the
body of her beloved dead, but a solemn-faced
man met her at the door and told her gently
but clearly that she could not enter.</p>

<p>She made no resistance, but allowed Lynde
Pyne to close the door and place her in a chair
beside the open window.</p>

<p>Her faculties seemed to be entirely restored,
but not a tear relieved the terrible brilliancy
of her eyes.</p>

<p>With the death of hope and the birth of
despair, had come a calm that had the appearance
of stoicism.</p>

<p>Lynde Pyne kneeled beside her, and taking
the small cold hands in his, chafed them tenderly.</p>

<p>"Leonie," he said gently, "I wish that you
would trust me, dear! I wish that you would
remember that there is nothing in all this
world that I would not do for you if you would
only let me. I wish that you would try to
think there is no trouble that I would not
bear for you, if by so doing, I could relieve
you of sorrow. You know that I would do
that, do you not?"</p>

<p>She bowed her head upon his hand, but
neither sigh nor moan escaped her.</p>

<p>"Child, you cannot bear this sorrow alone.
Why will you not trust me?"</p>

<p>"Because I cannot. It is part of the curse
that is upon me that I must suffer in silence.
There is only one thing, and if you would
promise that, there would be a load lifted
from my heart&mdash;a load of shame! What am
I saying? You must not listen to me, but&mdash;&mdash; You
know that I love you, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that," he answered, with a
curious intonation.</p>

<p>"Well, listen! There are reasons that
make it impossible for me to be your wife,
but"&mdash;holding his hands in a grasp like iron
and looking into his eyes with an earnestness
that was terrible&mdash;"it would kill me&mdash;to see&mdash;another&mdash;in
the place&mdash;that honor&mdash;forbids
me&mdash;to accept. Lynde! Lynde! promise me,
swear to me that you will not make Evelyn
Chandler your wife!"</p>

<p>She had arisen and was standing over him,
her hands still holding his, her wild eyes gazing
into his with a fierceness that was startling.</p>

<p>He arose slowly and stood before her.</p>

<p>"You wish me to break my word without
cause!" he said, gently. "Give me some reason
for it. Let me say to Miss Chandler that
I have been mistaken, that I love another,
and that that other will be my wife, with her
permission, and I consent. How could I go
to her and tell her that I must have my
promise back without an excuse to offer?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but if you love me, if you
would save me from a madhouse, you will
find a way. Lynde, promise me!"</p>

<p>"Tell me, Leonie, what had Evelyn Chandler
to do with this robbery?"</p>

<p>He spoke the words slowly and impressively.
She started, and for the moment seemed
about to faint, but quickly recovered herself.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" she answered, in a ghastly sort
of whisper.</p>

<p>"Don't you know that they will force it
from you upon the witness stand? Don't you
know that the most minute examination will
be made into your life and antecedents and
hers? Do you think you can conceal a fact
from these men where a family like that is
concerned? Why, there will not be an incident
from your birth to the present day that
they will not discover&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! You are driving me mad! I will
find a way to prevent that if I must seek
death to do it. Oh, my God&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In her frightful excitement she might have
told him all she knew and saved herself from
the terrible time that followed, had not the
door opened, and the undertaker entered.</p>

<p>"If you wish, Miss Cuyler," he said, gently,
"you may come in now."</p>

<p>Bowed, broken in spirit, heart-sore and
weary, she followed him.</p>

<p>Mechanically, Lynde Pyne was about to follow
her, when a messenger entered bearing a
note addressed to himself.</p>

<p>He tore it open and read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Come to your office at once. I must see
you.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Leonard Chandler.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>Reluctantly enough, Lynde Pyne left the
room in which the mortal remains of Godfrey
Cuyler lay, after having assured Leonie of
his immediate return, and went to the office
where Leonard Chandler awaited him.</p>

<p>Upon the way, his reflections were not enviable
ones. He felt quite convinced that
Leonie's agitation was not the result of her
grief occasioned by her grandfather's death.
On the contrary, there was something behind
that seemed to overshadow death, and cause
her almost to forget it.</p>

<p>What was it? and what had Evelyn Chandler
to do with it?</p>

<p>Those were the questions that he put to
himself persistently, and to which he found
no answer.</p>

<p>He gnawed his mustache in helpless silence,
his brows drawn in a heavy frown, and decided
upon the only course open to him, to
wait for the assistance that time renders.</p>

<p>That is not an easy method, particularly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
an impulsive man, but it was the only way.
His humor, therefore, was not of the pleasantest
when he entered the office to which he
had been so imperatively summoned.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Chandler!" he exclaimed
rather somberly, shaking hands. "I
am sorry that you were forced to wait for
me, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that, sir," interrupted Chandler,
not even the shadow of a smile lighting
the anger in his eyes. "I want an explanation
from you, sir. I understand that you
furnished the bail under which that girl,
Leonie Cuyler, was released from jail. Is
that true, sir?"</p>

<p>"It is perfectly true!"</p>

<p>"And you did that, knowing that I wished
her to remain there until she had sense
enough not to decline to reveal the name of a
thief?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Chandler. I am afraid I
did not think of your wishes upon the subject
at all. Miss Cuyler's grandfather, her only
living relative, died this morning. She was
as devoted to him as any own child could be,
and in common humanity, if there had been
no other reason, I could not have allowed her
to remain there."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose I cared for her
grandfather? That girl shall tell who the
thief who robbed my house was, or I will
prosecute her to the day of my death. I will
spend every cent of money that I possess, but
what I will find out the truth of this affair.
Do you understand that, Mr. Pyne? Nothing
in the shape of sentimentality shall deter me.
That girl went there for the purpose of convicting
the thief, and she shall do it."</p>

<p>The words were spoken slowly, and with
an emphasis upon each that showed Lynde
Pyne very clearly that his guest meant every
word he uttered, and more.</p>

<p>Pyne raised his foot, placed it upon a chair,
and leaned his arm upon his knee with greatest
nonchalance.</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed upon Chandler's calmly,
almost coldly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chandler," he said, impressively,
"for several years I have been your attorney.
You have always followed my advice implicitly
in every instance, and there has never
been a time when it has been incorrect! Am
I right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then there is reason why you should listen
to me in this. Do not press this case
against Miss Cuyler. If you do you may regret
it to the last day of your life. Withdraw
the charges you have made against
her."</p>

<p>"But I will not. Do you suppose that I
will let a matter like that rest? Never, I tell
you. Leonie Cuyler shall speak, or the whole
weight of my fortune shall be turned against
her. I direct you now to press this thing to
the last extremity. Let no stone go unturned.
Move heaven and earth to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Chandler. It is useless
for me to allow you to go further. If you
persist in this heartless scheme I must resign
from the case. I cannot act where my client
refuses to follow my directions."</p>

<p>Chandler lifted his eyes aghast.</p>

<p>"What!" he gasped. "You throw up all
the business that I have put into your hands
because of that girl? You must be mad!
Why, man, I will ruin you!"</p>

<p>"If you think you can you are perfectly
welcome to try, but I tell you frankly that
you have not enough money in your possession
to tempt me to lift a finger against
Leonie Cuyler."</p>

<p>"And you dare to tell me this? You, the
betrothed husband of my daughter!"</p>

<p>"I dare do anything that my conscience
and my duty may dictate, Mr. Chandler, regardless
of other considerations."</p>

<p>"Then I tell you, sir, that you shall never
enter my doors again! Remember that. If
you presume to call, the servants will have
instructions to throw you out. And as for
that Cuyler girl, I am all the more determined
that she shall be forced to tell all
she knows, if my entire fortune must be
spent upon it. Good-morning, Mr. Pyne. I
am afraid that you will discover before you
are through with it that this morning's work
is liable to cost you dear!"</p>

<p>He banged the door behind him, and for
many minutes Lynde Pyne stood there looking
at it intently, then he turned suddenly,
with a short, mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have played the dickens!"
he muttered. "But there seemed to be nothing
else for it. He will leave no stone unturned
to force this story from Leonie; she
will emphatically refuse to answer, and then&mdash;well,
God knows what will come after the
'and then!' There is nothing to think of now
but burying that man, and getting at the bottom
of these facts that threaten such danger
to Leonie."</p>

<p>"Mr. Davidge is here to see you, sir!"
said the office-boy, at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Tell him that I am out! That I have gone
over to the courtroom about a case that I
have on. Tell him anything that comes into
your head, but don't let me be interrupted
again to-day. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The boy had scarcely closed the door behind
him than Pyne leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>"I must go and see about that funeral!" he
exclaimed to himself. "That poor child is
there all alone, except for that ignorant mob.
What a relief it is to think that old Chandler
broke that engage&mdash;&mdash; Bah! that savored
very strongly of cowardice and almost dishonor;
but somehow I can't help feeling that
I am ten years younger."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>The golden hue of a dying sun lit up the
West, and shone with radiant glory into the
bare chamber where Leonie Cuyler sat, her
head bowed upon the arm of the chair in
which her grandfather had died.</p>

<p>She did not hear the knock that sounded
upon the door, nor did she hear it open, nor
see the man who entered.</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment in silence,
noting her extreme gracefulness even in a
position like that; he saw where the sun
kissed the bowed head as if in benediction;
he understood the terrible grief that hovered
over her, and something like tears gleamed
in his eyes as he went forward and drew a
chair close to her.</p>

<p>"Leonie," he said, taking her hand gently,
"arouse yourself, dear. Do you think you
are doing right to give way to your grief in
this manner? I know that it is hard to bear;
but it must come to us all sooner or later, and
he is at rest! Does that thought bring you no
consolation?"</p>

<p>She lifted her head, a terrible shiver shaking
her.</p>

<p>"It is the only consolation that I have!"
she answered drearily. "When I remember
how full his life was of sorrow that no time
could ever have lightened, I am glad that he
is at peace with God. But the burden is hard
to bear, when I am so bitterly alone, oh, God!
so horribly alone!"</p>

<p>"Do I count for nothing, then?"</p>

<p>"You are good to me, Mr. Pyne, so good
that you are breaking my heart afresh every
hour; but in justice to you I cannot accept
the friendship that is so sweet to me. In
mercy to myself I must refuse it! I have
been in the world so long that it is no secret
to me what construction is put upon the
friendship of a man like you for a creature in
my sphere and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leonie, I forbid you to speak like that.
You know no more of what you are saying
than a three-months-old child. There is no
man that will have a right to question my
motives when I say that I have asked you
to become my wife. I did not come here to-night
to speak to you upon this subject, nor
shall I. You must listen to me&mdash;you must see
the truth of what I say, for there is no time
to be lost. Have you forgotten that to-morrow
is the day set down for the hearing of your
case?"</p>

<p>Her hand closed over the arm of the chair,
her teeth were set firmly, her face became a
shade more ghastly, but her voice was quiet
as she answered:</p>

<p>"I had forgotten!"</p>

<p>"Then it is quite time that you remember,
Leonie. I have, without your request, or even
consent, constituted myself your attorney,
and it is to talk with you upon this subject
alone that I have come here to-night. I want
you to feel the strength of my love sufficiently
to know that you may trust me in all
things. Do you think that you can do
that?"</p>

<p>"I know that I can trust you!"</p>

<p>"Then tell me who committed that robbery!"</p>

<p>"I cannot!"</p>

<p>"I expected that answer, and yet you said
that you could trust me.</p>

<p>"Leonie, I entreat you, for your own sake,
to tell me the truth about this. If there is
anything that ought to be concealed, I will
help you to the last day of my life to conceal
it; but, for the love of Heaven, don't place
yourself in this hideous position without advice
from some one. Let me be the judge.
Tell me the truth, and I swear to you upon
my honor that, if there is reason for the concealment
I will help you to it!"</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, wiping away the
moisture from his brow that earnestness had
brought there.</p>

<p>Leonie straightened herself, and leaning
forward, laid her hand upon his.</p>

<p>"I know that what you are saying to me is
intended for my good alone," she cried, in a
choked voice, "and from the bottom of my
heart I thank you, but&mdash;I do not seem capable
of thought to-night. I do not seem to understand.
You are so good to me that I feel that
I can ask anything of you, and therefore I
beg that you will come to-morrow. Leave
me this night, my first without&mdash;dad&mdash;to myself,
and to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could not complete the sentence, but
turned away, hiding her quivering face upon
her arm.</p>

<p>Pyne stood beside her, placing his arm
about her.</p>

<p>"I have been cruel, but it was the only
way to save you," he whispered. "Tell me
that you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive," she answered,
lifting her dull eyes piteously. "If there
should ever come a time when you feel that
you have something to forgive me for, remember
that what I shall do will always be
for your good, will you not? Remember that
however unworthy I may be, that I loved you
with all my heart, and&mdash;&mdash; Oh, go! I beseech
you, go! I am not myself! To-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not finish the sentence, but raised
herself to her full height, looked him in the
face with a long, searching, hungry passion,
lifted his hand to her hot, dry lips, and pressing
a burning kiss upon it, passed hurriedly
from the room.</p>

<p>He looked after her for a moment irresolutely,
half tempted to follow.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" he asked of himself.
"Her manner was most singular. Poor little
girl. She is almost mad from this grief and
harassing. I wish I could have comforted
her instead of adding to it. Well, I will see
her to-morrow, and I will save her in spite of
herself."</p>

<p>He glanced longingly at the door through
which she had vanished.</p>

<p>Then restraining his inclination, he picked
up his hat and left the room.</p>

<p>Leonie heard the closing of the door, and
entered immediately.</p>

<p>How dreary and desolate it seemed!</p>

<p>Deliberately she had cut herself from him,
leaving herself absolutely alone, with not one
human being that she could call her friend.</p>

<p>A great pity for herself surged into her
heart, pity for the loneliness of her situation,
for the isolation that had been thrust upon
her through no fault of her own.</p>

<p>She sat down for a moment, burying her
face in her hands; then she lifted it, ghastly
with fierce determination.</p>

<p>"This is no time for inactivity or irresolution!"
she cried passionately. "I must follow
the life that Heaven has seen fit to fasten
upon me without consent of mine. I am a
nameless creature, but I can still have the
courage to save my sister. Lynde Pyne has
pledged himself to pay fifteen hundred dollars
to the court to-morrow in default of my
presence. Virtually I am simply forcing a
loan upon him, for it shall be repaid to the
last farthing. My weakness has fallen from
me like a mantle. When that is repaid, I
can allow my grief indulgence, but until
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She drew pen, ink and paper to her, and
began hastily to write the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Pyne</span>,&mdash;Realizing all the
truth of what you said to me last night, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
have decided to take matters into my own
hands. When you receive this, I shall be
many miles from here. I understand the fact
of your being compelled to pay the fifteen
hundred dollars for which you stand pledged
for me, but I promise that it shall be repaid
to the last penny with interest from date.
Thanking you for the kindly interest that you
have taken in me, and trusting that you will
forgive me for this step that is the only one
left me, I am</p>

<p class="sig0">
"Very truly yours,<br />
</p><p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Leonie Cuyler</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Not once, but many times she read the
note, taking it in her hands to destroy it; then
resolutely she placed it in an envelope, sealed,
addressed and stamped it.</p>

<p>"It sounds ungrateful, harsh, unfeeling,
but it is better so, much better," she muttered,
her lips drawn together coldly. "What
difference can my love make to him? It
could only bring disgrace and contamination.
It could only fill him with loathing if he
knew. He will learn to despise me when he
reads what I have written, and it is better
that he should."</p>

<p>She hesitated no longer, but pinning on her
hat, she went to the bureau, and taking from
it an old pocketbook, counted the few dollars
that remained in it; then she picked up her
letter, and with it clasped firmly in her hand,
went into the street.</p>

<p>An hour later she returned. She went to
the glass and removed her hat.</p>

<p>The beautiful hair that had been one of her
crowning glories was gone, and a little boyish
head that she could scarcely recognize as her
own was reflected there.</p>

<p>There was no satisfaction, only bitterness
in the face that looked back at her, and she
turned without a murmur.</p>

<p>She had begun her battle with life indeed!</p>

<p>She took up a bundle that she had thrown
upon the floor upon her entrance, and took
from it a full suit of boy's clothes.</p>

<p>Throwing off her own, she clothed herself
in the others, and again looked calmly into the
mirror when the task was completed.</p>

<p>The alteration was complete, absolute.</p>

<p>With the same mechanical movements she
opened the drawer to the old secretary, and
took from it the picture that Godfrey Cuyler
had told her was the face of Lena Mauprat,
but she thrust it into the pocket of her coat
without a glance at it.</p>

<p>There were one or two souvenirs of "Dad"
that she put into her pocket, then turned to
take a last view of the room in which she had
been comparatively happy.</p>

<p>A sob arose in her throat as she pictured
the face of her grandfather&mdash;that dear old
face that she was never again to see until she
met him in the presence of God!</p>

<p>With an unvoiced prayer in her heart, she
kneeled and kissed the chair in which he had
died, then slowly she arose and approached
the door.</p>

<p>One last glance, a bursting sob, and Leonie
Cuyler passed from the room forever!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p>"Neil?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor rushed into his library with
every appearance of haste and excitement
upon his kindly face, his breathing short, his
hair seeming to have taken an upward turn.</p>

<p>"I want you to go down on 'Change for
me. Hurry, boy! There is not a single moment
to lose. I want you to get there before
the market closes, and tell Caswell for me, to
buy two thousand Western Union, Buyer 30,
and sell five thousand Northwest preferred,
Seller 60. I have just had a 'pointer' by
which I shall make a pile if the market
goes as I have been informed. You have
just three-quarters to make it. If you get
there&mdash;&mdash; Ah, that is right. That boy is invaluable."</p>

<p>The sentence was finished to himself, the
break being caused by the exit of the boy to
whom he had been speaking.</p>

<p>The white-haired old gentleman stood for
some time with a smile upon his lips, rubbing
his hands together with an expression of profound
satisfaction.</p>

<p>But gradually it faded.</p>

<p>First came a look of deep thought, then one
of fear, followed by an expression so full of
consternation that to a disinterested observer
it would have been laughable.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed aloud, "I am
positive that I told that boy to buy Western
Union and sell Northwest preferred! If he
gives that order as I gave it to him, it will
ruin me! What in Heaven's name could ever
have made me such a colossal fool! It is impossible
to do anything now! He has been
gone fully fifteen minutes, and&mdash;what in the
name of common sense am I to do? Nothing, I
suppose. Five thousand Chicago and Northwestern
preferred short! Caswell will think
I have gone mad! Here! Sarah! Sarah! Tell
William to bring the cart to the door, quick!
There is not a moment to lose! Don't stand
staring at me in that insane way, but hurry!
There is not a confounded one of them on this
place that is worth the salt in their bread but
that boy whom I never saw until a week ago.
Where the devil is my coat? I never can find
it without that boy. Lord! if Caswell has
bought that&mdash;&mdash; Oh, here it is at last.
William, what in the name of Heaven are you
doing here? Didn't Sarah tell you to bring
the cart to the door?"</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind what you thought, you infernal
fool! What business had you to
think? It is too late now. I shall take the
elevated."</p>

<p>He banged the door after him as he spoke,
and hurried down the street to the nearest
elevated station, rushed up the steps, and was
forced to wait something over five minutes
for the train, during which time he looked at
his watch about twenty times.</p>

<p>The day was decidedly cool, but in spite
of that fact, the perspiration rolled down his
face like rain.</p>

<p>"I won't get there until the Exchange
closes," he muttered; "and with my affairs
in the state they are&mdash;&mdash; Well, I can't understand
what ever made me such an infernal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was interrupted by the arrival
of the train.</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor rushed in pell-mell, took his
seat, and imagined that the train had never
run with such exasperating slowness as upon
that occasion.</p>

<p>It came to an end at last, however, and colliding
with everything and everybody where
collision was possible, he rushed on.</p>

<p>At the very entrance of the Stock Exchange
he ran directly into the boy whom he had sent
upon the errand.</p>

<p>"What in thunder did you tell Caswell?"
cried the old man, excitedly. "Quick!"</p>

<p>The expression of the boy's face was laughable,
but partaking of his excitement, he answered,
breathlessly:</p>

<p>"I hope I have not done wrong, sir; but
going down in the train I remembered that
Northwest preferred had been jumping at an
astonishing rate the last few days, and I
thought you must have gotten the order
mixed."</p>

<p>"And you reversed it?"</p>

<p>"I did. Selling Western Union. Seller 60,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor's month opened as if to say
something, but it closed with a sudden snap,
and his hand came down on the boy's shoulder
with positive affection.</p>

<p>"My boy," he exclaimed, with amusing
emphasis, "you have saved me more than
you can imagine. The people in this town
would have had me adjudged a lunatic without
a trial if you had delivered that order as
I directed you. Such brains as yours shall
not go unrecognized. The fellows have been
laughing at me because of your youth and
girlishness, but they can laugh and be hanged!
You are my private secretary from this
day at a salary of one hundred and twenty-five
dollars per month. You are the smartest
boy of your age in New York to-day."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you overestimate what I have
done, sir. You see, I knew the market fluctuations
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you let me be the judge of that? I
tell you there is not another boy in the city
that would have done it. Well, it is something
in your pocket. You have made a
friend, and I am glad of it. You deserve it!"</p>

<p>The handsome eyes of the youth were
downcast. He did not reply, but somehow
Andrew Pryor seemed to understand that the
silence was not the result of ingratitude.</p>

<p>He preferred it, upon the whole, to a flow
of words, and attributed it to feeling upon the
part of the boy.</p>

<p>Together they went home, and at the door
inside the hall Andrew Pryor paused again,
laying his hand upon the shoulder of the
young man.</p>

<p>"I shall expect you to dine with the family
to-night," he said. "It is the respect your
new position demands!"</p>

<p>A brilliant, embarrassed red overspread the
handsome face, which the patron was not
slow to observe.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he demanded. "Remember
perfect frankness is always best."</p>

<p>The boy smiled.</p>

<p>"It seems such an absurd thing, sir," he
answered, "and yet I must ask you to excuse
me, because I do not possess a dress suit!"</p>

<p>"Then you will come without one until it
is purchased. A dress suit does not make the
gentleman. If you have not the money that
is required, do not hesitate to call upon me.
There must be none of that false pride about
you that is so despicable in most young men.
I have taken a great liking to you, and I am
determined to see you succeed in the world.
There are very few of us who would have occupied
our present positions had there not
been a helping hand extended to us. Mine
will be the hand to assist you up the ladder to
social prominence and wealth. We dine at
6:30. I shall expect you."</p>

<p>Neil Lowell bowed respectfully, but quietly,
and passing up the stairs, went to his own
room.</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor looked after him.</p>

<p>"That is the most extraordinary boy that I
ever knew!" he muttered. "Some day I must
get him to tell me the story of his life. I
would be willing to stake my head that his
parents were somebody!"</p>

<p>And in his own room, a comfortable nest,
not elegant, but cozy and homelike, Neil
Lowell threw aside his hat and coat, and seating
himself in front of the fire, bowed his
chin upon his breast and was lost in reflection.</p>

<p>"What a strange world it is!" he muttered.
"Only a little while ago, and as a girl, as
poor, unfortunate Leonie Cuyler, my heart
seemed breaking. I was friendless, and helpless,
made desperate by my struggle with life.
Driven to bay, I gave myself the appearance
of a boy. For a time I feared the tracing of
detectives. I lived in constant terror, hiding
by day, living in dread at night, subsisting
upon the few crumbs that came in my way,
or starving, as occasion demanded, until I
could bear it no longer! I threw aside fear,
and determined that whatever the consequences
might be, I would brave it out. I
obtained some light work; I went from that
to my old work of typewriting, but the girls
monopolized that, and I was a&mdash;boy. However,
I got enough money together to buy a
decent suit of clothes, accidentally performed a
slight service for Andrew Pryor, was taken
into his employ to do anything that came my
way that was not menial, though I don't
know that I should have refused that had it
come my way, and now I am his private
secretary. It is a curious world! I wonder
what in Heaven's name is in store for me?
They must all discover sooner or later that I
am not what I appear, but how can I help it?
It is useless to repine now! There is no going
back. It is forward or die, and I am not
ready for that yet. Thank God for one
thing. It will enable me to repay the debt
that I owe to Lynde Pyne! Suppose that he
knew the truth? Suppose that he knew that
but yesterday he had stood beside me, Leonie
Cuyler? Suppose&mdash;&mdash; But the time for supposing
anything is over. I am Neil Lowell
now, and Neil Lowell I shall remain to the
end of the chapter. I even intend to try to
forget that I am not the boy that I appear.
There is no reason why I should not remain
Neil Lowell. I have as much right to that
name as any other. As a boy, life promises
something to me, as a girl, it holds nothing
but disgrace and shame. Let me see! If I
am to appear at that dinner-table I must be
presentable. I shall have just time to go
down-town and make some necessary purchases
before the dinner hour. Ha! ha! It
does seem too absurd to think of Leonie Cuyler
in the bosom of the family of Andrew
Pryor as a fine young man, and his private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
secretary. I suppose I shall be making love
to one of the girls next."</p>

<p>The expression of the beautiful face was
nearer to amusement than any that had
shadowed it since that death on the top floor
of the tenement, that Leonie Cuyler had
called her home.</p>

<p>The black derby was pulled down to carefully
conceal the broad brow, and with a very
boyish swing to his gait, Neil Lowell passed
out of the house again.</p>

<p>The few necessary purchases were made,
the suit that Andrew Pryor required at his
dinner-table was ordered, and Neil Lowell returned
home.</p>

<p>He had scarcely completed his preparations
when the chimes announced dinner.</p>

<p>With a heart that thrilled with embarrassment,
but well concealed by the most composed
exterior, he descended to the dinner-room.</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor received him.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said to his wife, "you have
known this young man as a boy to whom I
have taken a great liking, but for a service
rendered me to-day that shows his capability
to fill such a position with credit to himself, I
have made him my private secretary. I wish
him in future to be received as a member of
my family. Gwen, my dear, come here.
Miss Pryor, allow me to present Mr. Lowell!"</p>

<p>The formal introduction was made to his
eldest daughter, who bowed courteously, then
followed by an introduction to the others,
two in number.</p>

<p>Gravely, and with the polish of a courtier,
Neil Lowell responded to the introduction,
filling Andrew Pryor with more surprise than
ever.</p>

<p>"Where in thunder did the boy get his
polish?" he kept asking himself all through
dinner, but the end came without his having
found a reply.</p>

<p>"He is a charming boy!" Alice told her
sister, Gwendolyn, when they were alone in
their own room.</p>

<p>And Gwendolyn, contrary to her custom,
did not negative the assertion.</p>

<p>It was altogether a triumph for Neil Lowell,
and the tears that moistened his pillow that
night were girlish, but they were not tears of
sadness entirely.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>"Lowell!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Answering that batch of letters that came
by the morning delivery."</p>

<p>"Well, stop! I'm tired of it. It seems to
me that you do nothing eternally but work
from morning until night!"</p>

<p>The sweet face was lifted, all dimpled with
smiles.</p>

<p>"Was not that what you engaged me
for?"</p>

<p>"Not exclusively. I don't want any fellow
to make himself a slave for me. Are
you going to the Dorlans to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Why?"&mdash;testily.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know any one, sir, and it
did not seem to me that I should be missed.
It was very kind of Mr. Dorlan to ask me, but
I did not think that he expected me to accept.
He only did it because he thought you would
like it."</p>

<p>"Then you acknowledge that you have not
as much consideration for my feelings as he
has."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you make that, sir."</p>

<p>"He, you say, invited you because I wanted
him to, and you won't go, knowing that I
am very anxious that you should!"</p>

<p>"I did not know that, sir!"</p>

<p>"Well, you know it now. Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Not if you will excuse me."</p>

<p>"I will not press you if you wish that I
should not. By the way, Lowell, won't you
have a cigar?"</p>

<p>The silver case was lifted and held upward
for the young man to select one to his own
liking. Half a dozen dimples played about
his pretty mouth as Neil Lowell suppressed
an outright laugh.</p>

<p>"I never smoke, thank you, sir," he answered.</p>

<p>"What? Oh, hang it, I always forget you
are only a boy. You have so few of the frivolities
of youth that I can never seem to remember
that you are not an old man. I have no
prejudice against smoking, though, for old or
young, if not carried to excess. You must
learn. It is a great comfort, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor paused as the door of his
study was thrown open without permission,
and Alice, his youngest daughter, entered.</p>

<p>"Papa," she cried enthusiastically, "I
have just had a letter from Edith. It has
been delayed somehow upon the road, and I
find by comparing the dates that she will be
here to-night. Isn't that just perfectly lovely?
She said it would be impossible for her
to tell exactly by what train she would arrive,
but that we need not trouble to meet her, as
her cousin would be with her, and he could
bring her to the house at once, but that she
would arrive in time for dinner! I am so
pleased!"</p>

<p>She threw her arms around the old gentleman's
neck, and proceeded to half suffocate
him in her demonstrations of joy.</p>

<p>"Gwen is as happy as I am," she continued,
her black eyes dancing with delight. "I have
already planned a thousand different things
for her entertainment. The dinner to-night
must be just lovely. Don't you think I had
better invite a few people, impromptu, don't
you know?"</p>

<p>"I dare say that would be very pleasant,
but I am going to Dorlan's to a stag dinner,"
returned Pryor sheepishly, as though knowing
that his absence from home would be regarded
very much as a crime.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa!"</p>

<p>The pretty face fell, the corners of the
little mouth were drawn downward, and the
tiny hand fell from his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Now then&mdash;now then!" cried Pryor, rising
and patting her cheeks lightly. "You need
not look as though I had locked you up in
the closet. This dinner has been arranged for
a week, and I could not possibly decline. But
that need not hinder your arrangements at
all, for Lowell will be here, and he can act in
my place. I shall perhaps be able to make
my own excuses before I leave, and just
authorize him to do the honors. I don't think
I would ask any one but Edith's cousin, then
you can make a little family dinner of the
first one."</p>

<p>"And are you not going to the stag dinner,
Mr. Lowell?" asked Miss Pryor, lifting her
sweet eyes to his face, glowing with good
humor again.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That is just lovely of you. I should kiss
you if I dared."</p>

<p>"I shall not resist in the least," laughed
Neil.</p>

<p>"Well, some other time! Then we shall
have the family dinner to-night. Oh, I shall
be so glad to see Edith! I do wonder what
her cousin is like? I hope he will be pleasant
and companionable for you, Mr. Lowell."</p>

<p>"That is very kind of you, Miss Alice, but
I much prefer the society of the ladies."</p>

<p>"Right again, Lowell! Gad! you are the
most sensible boy I ever saw!" exclaimed Mr.
Pryor admiringly.</p>

<p>"Then we may count upon you for dinner
to-night, Mr. Lowell?" interrupted Alice.</p>

<p>"I am always at your service, Miss Alice."</p>

<p>"That is so good of you. But there is one
warning that I have to give you. Don't fall
in love with Edith. She is already engaged,
but the greatest little flirt in existence."</p>

<p>"I am not susceptible, Miss Alice. If I had
been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A look completed the sentence, a look that
brought the quick color to the pretty, round
cheeks, which Neil Lowell was not slow to
see.</p>

<p>The girl kissed her father and hurried from
the room. The old man glanced from Lowell
to the closed door, and back again, in much
surprise.</p>

<p>"Neil," he said, after a long, thoughtful
pause, "that is a subject upon which jests
are not admissible."</p>

<p>"I understand you, sir, and I beg that you
will feel no anxiety whatever upon that point.
I am too young to fear."</p>

<p>"No, you are not. Your face is unusually
handsome, and&mdash;&mdash; Remember, boy, I do not
speak for my daughter's sake alone, but yours
as well."</p>

<p>"I made up my mind, Mr. Pryor, some
time ago, and I shall keep to my resolution,
that I shall never marry. I beg that you will
feel no concern for either me or&mdash;for her.
Will you excuse me? We neither of us have
much time in which to dress for dinner."</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor nodded a consent, and with
infinite amusement in his heart, and amusement
that was to be piteously short-lived,
Neil Lowell sought his room to dress for
that dinner that was to linger long in his
memory.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>Neil Lowell had never looked better in
his boy's attire than when he had completed
his toilet for dinner that evening, and stood
before the glass taking a last survey of himself,
very much after the manner of a girl.
Then he opened the door and went down-stairs.</p>

<p>As he entered the drawing-room, his first
impression was that it was empty, but as he
advanced into the room, he saw the form of
a man leaning over a table upon which some
rare etchings were carelessly tossed.</p>

<p>"It is 'Edith's cousin,' I suppose," he muttered
with a smile.</p>

<p>The slight noise of the entrance attracted
the stranger's attention, and he lifted his
head.</p>

<p>Neil started; an hysterical cry rose to his
lips, but before the guest had advanced he
had recovered his perfect self-possession.</p>

<p>"You are Miss Edith's 'cousin,' I think,"
he said with a smile, advancing and extending
his hand. "I don't suppose that Miss
Alice intended us to meet in this fashion or
she would have told me your name. I am
Neil Lowell."</p>

<p>The gentleman paused, looking down upon
the slight figure with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>He took the extended hand in his as though
half unconscious that he had done so, then
pulling himself together, he said slowly:</p>

<p>"I am Lynde Pyne. I have heard your
name mentioned by my cousin as the private
secretary of Mr. Pryor, of whom Miss Alice
has made frequent mention in her letters.
You must really excuse me, but your face is
so strangely familiar to me, that I cannot recover
from the surprise of it."</p>

<p>"Now that you speak of it, I remember
seeing you on 'Change the other day. The
day that Lake Shore took its great boom.
Do you not recall it?"</p>

<p>"No!" shaking his head slowly, "it was
not there. I did not see you there, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was interrupted by the entrance
of the girls. Introductions followed,
and were barely completed, when the butler's
announcement of dinner was made.</p>

<p>With a heart beating almost to suffocation,
Lowell offered his arm to Miss Edith Pyne,
and conducted her to the dining-room, seating
her upon his right, while he occupied the
host's position.</p>

<p>It placed him where every eye rested full
upon him, and Alice cried gleefully:</p>

<p>"Is it not extraordinary? Look! Did you
ever see so great a resemblance as that between
Mr. Lowell and Edith?"</p>

<p>There was no need to call attention to it,
for every one in the room had observed it before,
but Lowell's face was crimson.</p>

<p>"You compliment me too highly, Miss
Alice," he stammered. "No doubt that is
where Mr. Pyne saw a resemblance in me to
some one, if it is true."</p>

<p>But Pyne shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "I must have seen you,
yourself! I can't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was dreamily discontinued,
and the girls began to chatter upon other subjects,
while Lowell and Pyne maintained an
uncomfortable silence.</p>

<p>"It is so delicious to be here!" Edith cried
joyfully, "only it will be for such a short
time. Mamma insists that I shall spend part
of the visit with Evelyn Chandler. I ought
to be pleased, I suppose, but I can't. I should
not say it before Lynde, but I don't half like
her."</p>

<p>If his life had depended upon it, Lowell could
not have prevented himself from raising his
eyes to those dark, compelling ones before
him. They were fixed curiously upon his face.
A slow color surged into the pink cheeks and
the eyes of the boy were lowered.</p>

<p>An excitement that he could not control
leaped into Lynde's eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why should you not say that before Mr.
Pyne?" questioned Miss Pryor. "If rumor is
correct his engagement with Miss Chandler
is at an end."</p>

<p>Lowell held his breath, waiting for the
answer.</p>

<p>Not a movement was lost upon Pyne.</p>

<p>"Then rumor does not speak correctly!"
snapped Miss Pyne. "I wish to Heaven it
did. The engagement was broken by some
kind of row between Mr. Chandler and Lynde
at the time those robberies were committed,
but Evelyn would not have it. She made her
father straighten matters out, and Lynde was
hooked again, and will be landed in January.
You see, the fish is about tired out, and the
fisher-woman will soon be triumphant."</p>

<p>Lowell felt himself growing ghastly.</p>

<p>A cold perspiration was growing about his
mouth; but knowing that Pyne's eyes were
fixed upon him, he forced a smile to his lips,
and glanced in Pyne's direction.</p>

<p>"Then I presume we are to congratulate
you?" he said, in the form of an interrogation.</p>

<p>The trembling of the voice was not lost
upon Lynde, who never removed his eyes
from the boyish face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered slowly, "you may congratulate
me if you wish."</p>

<p>"I should murder him if he did!" ejaculated
Miss Pyne. "You know that I don't
like Evelyn, and she knows it, though mamma
insists upon it that I shall be the essence
of glucose in her presence. Bah! what you
want to marry her for is more than I can see.
You are not in love with her, and you know
it."</p>

<p>"Young ladies," interrupted Mrs. Pryor,
with a good-natured smile, "don't you think
this conversation had better be discontinued?
It is the first time I ever heard of discussing
a gentleman's <i>fiancee</i> so uncomplimentarily
in his presence."</p>

<p>"Pooh! We are all like brothers and sisters
here!" exclaimed Miss Pyne. "It is only
in the family, you know. Mr. Lowell don't
count. Did you ever see Miss Evelyn Chandler,
Mr. Lowell?"</p>

<p>For a moment Lowell hesitated, then the
answer came:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you admire her?"</p>

<p>"If you mean do I think she is beautiful,
yes."</p>

<p>"But do you think she is good? Do you
think she is what she appears?"</p>

<p>"You must excuse me, Miss Pyne. I have
not your right to discuss the lady in question."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pryor, not approving the conversation,
arose from the table, giving the signal to the
ladies.</p>

<p>Lowell arose, and opened the door for them
to pass through, then he resumed his seat.</p>

<p>He was the host, in the absence of Mr.
Pryor, and he knew that he must remain at
the table until his guest was ready to leave it.</p>

<p>During the time that the butler was arranging
the cigars and wine upon the table, after
the departure of the ladies, he felt those
glowing eyes fixed upon his face.</p>

<p>The wine was poured, and the butler handed
the cigars.</p>

<p>As they were passed to Neil, he glanced up,
and saw those curious, questioning eyes still
fixed upon him. He selected a cigar with
greatest nonchalance; the lighted candles
were placed for their use, and the butler retired.</p>

<p>As though it were an occurrence of everyday
life, Neil cut the end from his cigar,
stuck it in his mouth, and was about to apply
it to the flame, when Pyne put out his hand
and laid it upon that of the boy.</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" he said gently.</p>

<p>Lowell did not need to affect the surprise
that came to his eyes.</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Because it will make you sick!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that you have never smoked a
cigar in your life, and that it will nauseate
you."</p>

<p>For a moment there was an uncomfortable
silence, then Neil laughed shortly.</p>

<p>"You are correct," he said, his face flushing.
"I never did! Mr. Pryor was taking
me to task about it to-day, and I determined
to learn. I did not dream that I should
handle it so awkwardly. Will you excuse
me, then, if I take a cigarette instead?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; but I don't think I feel inclined
to smoke, if you will excuse me altogether.
The chatter of those girls has upset me. It
has brought back memories which I thought
I had conquered. Neil Lowell, there is a
question that I should like to ask you. What
is it that you know of Miss Evelyn Chandler?
And what relation are you to Leonie Cuyler?"</p>

<p>The man's face was lighted with a brilliant
crimson. His eyes glittered with excitement.</p>

<p>He arose from his chair and stood over the
boy, one hand resting upon the table, the
other upon the back of Lowell's chair.</p>

<p>The boy lifted his eyes to the thrilling face,
and very slowly arose to his feet.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>For a full minute Neil Lowell and Lynde
Pyne stood there facing each other, each
seeming to measure the other's strength, not
physically, but mentally.</p>

<p>Neil was striving to decide what course it
would be safest for him to pursue; then,
seeming to have arrived at a definite conclusion,
he stepped back a pace, his eyes growing
colder.</p>

<p>"What I know of Miss Evelyn Chandler,"
he said, frigidly, "is my own concern, and
there is no reason why I should make it
known to you or to any one else, unless it is
my desire so to do. I have made no charges
either for or against her, and I deny your
right to question me upon that or any other
subject."</p>

<p>Pyne threw out his hand with a deprecatory
gesture.</p>

<p>"I did not ask my question in the spirit
that you seem to ascribe to me," he replied,
without anger; "the expression of your face,
when these family affairs were spoken of,
was such as to give birth to suspicion. I do
not demand that you answer me; I simply request
it."</p>

<p>Neil turned aside, lowering his eyes.</p>

<p>"There is nothing that I can tell you concerning
Miss Chandler."</p>

<p>"Then answer my second question. What
are you to Leonie Cuyler?"</p>

<p>Slowly the boy lifted his eyes, fastening
them on the face of the man before him, determined
that no weakness, however great,
should make him betray the identity that it
was so necessary for him to conceal.</p>

<p>"I had a cousin by that name," he said,
slowly. "I never saw her but once."</p>

<p>He had told the truth, and he had told it
with such perfect frankness, such entire candor,
that Pyne was staggered.</p>

<p>"Then if you have seen her once, you will
excuse me for my inquiry into your affairs,
knowing how much you are like her."</p>

<p>"There is little in resemblances. You heard
Miss Pryor speak to-night of my resemblance
to Miss Pyne, your cousin."</p>

<p>"That is strong, I grant you, but weak by
comparison with the other likeness. In asking
your pardon I must tell you that my interest
in Miss Cuyler was so strong at one
time that it has shadowed all my life. I cannot
speak further without betraying a secret
that is not all mine. But for her sake, because
you were her cousin, I offer you my
friendship, if you will have it. I am not rich,
but whatever I can do for you you may be
sure that I will. You promise?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the boy were averted to conceal
the tears that would rise in them.</p>

<p>"I will remember!" he answered, in a voice
so choked from emotion that vision was not
necessary to know the nearness of tears.</p>

<p>"Will you give me your hand that I may
know you have forgiven me for my presumption?"</p>

<p>Without a word the little hand was extended,
and as that of the man closed over it, a
quick, low cry escaped his lips.</p>

<p>"You cannot deceive me longer!" he cried,
hoarsely. "I knew that you were Leonie in
the beginning, but I wanted to have some
proof before making my assertion. Oh,
Leonie, child, child! why did you think it
necessary to conceal your identity from me?
Did you not know that I would have given
my life, my soul, if needs were, to have saved
you?"</p>

<p>Startled almost beyond self-control, Leonie
listened to the words.</p>

<p>She knew that the ring she wore had betrayed
her, but she could think of no way in
which it was possible to cover the fact that he
had discovered.</p>

<p>Very gently Lynde closed the door, then
turning, took her hand and drew her down
upon a couch beside him.</p>

<p>"Leonie," he said, "could you not have
trusted me?"</p>

<p>"I did trust you," she cried desperately,
"and you are to marry Evelyn Chandler!"</p>

<p>She had not meant to say that, but somehow
the words had escaped her without her
will. She would have recalled them if she
could, but now it was too late. She lifted her
eyes helplessly to his face.</p>

<p>"You trusted me by leaving me at the time
that I needed you most. You trusted me by
going away and leaving me in ignorance as to
your whereabouts. You might have known
that at any price I would save you, and I
have. It is not necessary that you should
longer disguise your sex from the world. The
charge that Leonard Chandler made against
you has been withdrawn."</p>

<p>Leonie started up excitedly.</p>

<p>"Withdrawn!" she gasped. "How did he
happen to do that?"</p>

<p>"Through the persuasion of his daughter."</p>

<p>For a moment she was silent, then she
sprung up, standing before him, her lovely
face quivering with emotion.</p>

<p>"Then that is the secret of your renewed
engagement with Evelyn Chandler. Tell me
the truth, Lynde. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>His eyes were downcast for a moment, then
raised bravely.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "You must not ask
me anything further, because honor forbids
that I should answer you. But you are free
as air."</p>

<p>"I am free, but you!" she cried, her voice
scarcely more than an agonized whisper&mdash;"you
are worse than a prisoner! You do not
love her, and, not loving her, you will marry
her for my sake. Listen to me, Lynde. You
must not do it&mdash;you must not, if I go to the
gallows instead of to the penitentiary! You
have taught me a lesson in self-sacrifice. I
shall not tell you now the secret that has
moved my life, that has robbed it of every
hope, of every joy, because my unsupported
testimony would count for little; but I will
find a way to prove my words; and I will save
you from the woman whom you would make
your wife!"</p>

<p>"I beg that you will not do that, Leonie.
There is nothing now that could relieve me of
the sacred promise that I have taken upon myself,
and anything that you might say would
but be a useless sacrifice upon your part, and
would but increase my burden. Promise me
that you will do nothing!"</p>

<p>"I will promise to say nothing to any one
until you know all the truth, and that you
shall be the judge yourself. Will you be content
with that?"</p>

<p>"I will!"</p>

<p>"And there is a promise that I have to demand
of you in return."</p>

<p>"I am ready to make it!"</p>

<p>"Then say nothing of what you have discovered
to-day regarding my sex to any one!
I have reasons for wishing to preserve myself
from recognition, and there is little hope for
me unless I preserve the costume that I have
assumed. If I am forced to leave here, as I
should be were it known that I am not a boy,
Heaven knows into what a position I might
be thrown."</p>

<p>"I promise. You will not refuse to allow
me to see you sometimes? You will not refuse
to grant me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is better not!" she interrupted, sorrowfully.
"There is nothing that can ever lift
the barrier that lies between you and me, Mr.
Pyne. That is as irrevocable as death itself.
I am not saving you from Evelyn Chandler
to secure you for myself. The reason that
makes it almost a crime that she should be
your wife, extends to me, and though I have
brought you sorrow, I will never bring you
disgrace. When you are here I shall find a
pretext for remaining out of your presence,
for it is much better that we should not
meet! You believe that, do you not?"</p>

<p>"I beg that you will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am deaf to your words. You know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
where to find me; you know where I shall
remain, unless the object that I have in view
requires that I shall go elsewhere; but unless
necessity demands it, I beg that you will not
seek me. I will come to you when I have
discovered the proofs that are necessary."</p>

<p>She left the room as she ceased speaking
without a backward glance, turning a deaf
ear to his pleading tones, and walked unsteadily
up the stairs to her own room.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p>"There's a lady in the blue morning-room
to see you, Miss Chandler!"</p>

<p>Evelyn Chandler turned to her maid with
anything but an amiable expression of countenance.</p>

<p>"Her card?" she exclaimed with annoyance.</p>

<p>"She gave me none. She wished me to
say that her call was purely a matter of business,
that she would not detain you longer
than necessity required, and begged that you
would not decline to see her."</p>

<p>Something in the message aroused Miss
Chandler's curiosity.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment; then with a gesture
of deprecation, said:</p>

<p>"Show her up here! I don't feel inclined
to walk down-stairs."</p>

<p>Concealing the disgust she felt at the well-known
indolence of her mistress, the maid
left the room, but returned a little later,
followed by a woman clothed in somber black.</p>

<p>A heavy veil was drawn across her face, a
covering which she took the precaution not
to remove until the maid had retired and
closed the door.</p>

<p>"My maid tells me your call is upon business,"
said Miss Chandler, curtly. "I have
but a few moments to spare, therefore, you
will excuse me if I ask you to be brief."</p>

<p>Without a word the veil was lifted, revealing
the lovely features of Leonie Cuyler.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler was on the point of crying
out, but by a mighty effort restrained the inclination.</p>

<p>She drew herself up coldly, a thousand
lightning flashes darting from her eyes.</p>

<p>"To what am I indebted for the honor of
this visit?" she asked icily.</p>

<p>"It is to tell you that I have come," returned
Leonie, quietly taking a chair that had
not been offered her. "Will you excuse me
if I consume a little of your valuable time in
telling you how I risked my freedom and my
honor only a short time ago to save you from
the consequences of your own folly. Will
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I will not!" interrupted Miss Chandler
sternly. "I am quite convinced that you
have not come here without a purpose, therefore
I request that you state it as speedily as
possible, and without all this circumlocution.
If you wish to impress me with the idea that
I am under an obligation to you, I may as
well assure you in the beginning that I do not
recognize the fact; and even if I did, I am
not one to be influenced by such considerations."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Leonie, assuming something
of Miss Chandler's own manner. "If
you are determined to have this war and not
peace, I am ready for you.</p>

<p>"There was one," she continued, "to whom
I owe more than I could ever repay were I
granted a thousand years of life. No brother
could have shown me greater tenderness,
greater consideration, greater mercy."</p>

<p>"How touching!" murmured Miss Chandler,
stifling a yawn.</p>

<p>"I refer," Leonie went on, as though the
interruption had not been made, "to Mr.
Lynde Pyne."</p>

<p>"I supposed as much. Lynde was always
something of a Don Quixote. It is pleasant
to hear of his generosity, but really if you
don't hurry I shall have to leave you. I
should not like, for your own sake, to have
my father find you here."</p>

<p>"I have come to tell you, Miss Chandler,
that the engagement that exists between you
and Lynde Pyne must be broken!"</p>

<p>Miss Chandler shrugged her shapely shoulders
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Have you come here to threaten me?"
she asked coldly. "If you have you will find
that you have attacked the wrong person. I
think I have already demonstrated to you the
fact that I am not in the least a coward."</p>

<p>She arose as she finished her sentence, and
Leonie followed her example.</p>

<p>"Promise me," she said, "and keep your
word, that you will break this engagement,
and I swear to you, that so far as I am concerned,
the secret of your birth and the
knowledge of who was the thief in Leonard
Chandler's household, shall be eternally preserved.
Refuse, and whatever it may cost
me, the entire matter shall be made public in
time to save Lynde Pyne from the marriage
that would not alone wreck his life, but his
soul as well."</p>

<p>"I make no compact with you of any
kind!" said Evelyn, harshly. "If you make
this charge, without bringing ample proof to
back up your assertions, I warn you that my
father, Leonard Chandler, shall use the force
of his entire fortune against you. His anger
against you is already at fever heat, and I have
but to speak the word that will make him
your most deadly foe. As far as my love for
Mr. Pyne is concerned, that is none of your
business. Whether I love him or not, I intend
to marry him, for reasons that do not in the
least concern you. Now go, or the servants
shall have instructions to put you out!"</p>

<p>There was not the slightest weakness in her
demeanor, and Leonie knew it.</p>

<p>She had hoped to frighten her sister into
measures, but she saw there was about as
much possibility of that, as there was in
frightening a desperado into giving himself
into the hands of the authorities.</p>

<p>With little outward evidence of the disappointment
she really felt, Leonie again wrapped
the veil about her head and left the
room.</p>

<p>For some time Evelyn Chandler stood there,
seeming to be thinking deeply.</p>

<p>"She means every word that she has said,"
she muttered, below her breath. "She was a
typewriter in a lawyer's office long enough to
have absorbed some of their knowledge, and
will, therefore, know exactly how to go to
work. I cannot sit still and let her succeed,
as undoubtedly she will if I do not immediately
take measures of precaution; but
what shall they be? I cannot consult my
adopted father. Therefore, there is but one
course left&mdash;I must consult my own father.
Bah!"</p>

<p>The sentence was concluded with a shiver
of repulsion, but it vanished almost before it
had existed.</p>

<p>She sat down and took her chin in her
hands, a favorite position when in deep
thought.</p>

<p>"It is the only way!" she cried, at last.
"Let me see! I have an engagement with my
dressmaker at this hour, but when that is
ended, we shall see what Ben Mauprat can
suggest. A man who has been a scoundrel all
his life certainly ought to be able to thwart a
single-handed girl."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p>"Mr. Pryor, will you require my services
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>The speaker was Neil Lowell, who stood
in the presence of his employer, hat in
hand.</p>

<p>The old gentleman glanced up in surprise.</p>

<p>"No! That is the first time you have ever
asked that. Are you going out?"</p>

<p>"With your permission."</p>

<p>"Hang it, boy, a servant has some time off,
and you never take any. It would really do
me good to have you go out more. You
never do unless I send you. Go, and come
back when you get ready."</p>

<p>"Thank you!"</p>

<p>Lowell did not wait for further words, but
left the room, and instead of going directly
to the street, as his dress would have indicated
that he intended, he went to his room
again.</p>

<p>He locked the door and hurriedly disrobed.
Ten minutes later, a red-brown wig was drawn
over his cropped head, and a suit that indicated
shabby gentility had taken its place.
An old and much-worn hat was placed upon
his head, completing a most excellent disguise.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Pryor, or any one in the house discovers
me, I shall tell him quietly that I am
engaged upon a piece of detective work, and
he will be perfectly satisfied and ask no
further questions, bless his dear old heart;
but I must prevent detection if I can," muttered
the boy to himself as he left the room,
and, taking the servants' stairway, went down
and very quietly let himself into the street.</p>

<p>He took the elevated train and rode down-town,
leaving it at the Bleecker Street Station,
then walked quickly across town.</p>

<p>The place that he entered was one that
would have made a man's heart stand still,
much less that of a person built upon his
small scale, and for a single moment he hesitated,
but the hesitation was scarcely long
enough to be called one.</p>

<p>It was a low saloon, and one in the "ring"
could easily have recognized more than one
member of the Whyo gang in that motley assemblage.</p>

<p>Blurred eyes were lifted questioningly, and
the boy was "taken in" from head to foot.</p>

<p>Disregarding all this, and affecting a boldness
he was far from feeling, he advanced to
the man behind the bar and said, in a low
tone:</p>

<p>"Say, pard, I've been told that you kin tell
a feller where to find Ben Mauprat. Ef yer
kin, yer'll do a good day's work fur Ben!"</p>

<p>"Say, Ike!" the barkeeper called to a man
across the room, "this here kid wants to
know where Ben Mauprat lives. Kin you tell
him?"</p>

<p>"Cert! he lives on Great Jones Street&mdash;Number
&mdash;&mdash;. He is sweller than we are.
Shouldn't wonder but what he'd be one of the
four hundred before the month's up."</p>

<p>The boy did not wait to hear the conclusion
of the speech, but, muttering some words of
thanks that "Ike" did not condescend to notice,
he left the saloon.</p>

<p>He walked rapidly in the direction of Great
Jones Street.</p>

<p>The number that had been indicated was
not a desirable-looking residence, but no
doubt to the other men of his class, Ben Mauprat's
home was eminently respectable, if not
elegant.</p>

<p>At least it required a pull at the bell to effect
an entrance.</p>

<p>A slatternly woman answered the summons.</p>

<p>"Ben in?" questioned the boy.</p>

<p>"What do you want of him?"</p>

<p>"I want to see him. What do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, he is asleep."</p>

<p>"Wake him up; my business can't wait!"</p>

<p>The boy's manner was an excellent imitation
of the tough, and, half afraid to refuse, the
woman reluctantly pulled open the door and
allowed him to enter.</p>

<p>"He's in there," she said, indicating a
room. "You can wake him yourself, for
his temper ain't none too good at the best of
times."</p>

<p>She went back to her work, and noiselessly
Neil Lowell entered the room that she had
pointed out to him.</p>

<p>There, upon an old hair-cloth lounge, lay
the man whom he heard talking to Evelyn
Chandler on that memorable night.</p>

<p>Ben Mauprat did not move.</p>

<p>The same heavy snores that had greeted
Neil upon his entrance continued, perhaps a
trifle louder, and feeling that he was secure
from interruption from the woman who had
admitted him, Neil began a hasty survey of
the premises.</p>

<p>There was not much to see.</p>

<p>A broken chair, a table, with pieces of wood
propping up one leg, an old secretary, with
one door wrenched off, a dilapidated inkstand,
and that seemed to be about all.</p>

<p>Lightly Neil stepped to the secretary and
began looking over its contents.</p>

<p>The first thing that met his eyes was a
dainty note that even the grimy hands of Ben
Mauprat could not rob of its beauty.</p>

<p>Without the slightest hesitation he opened
it. There was no beginning. It simply read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nothing has been heard of the girl yet.
We must find her at all hazards, and make
sure that her mouth is securely closed, for
upon that all depends. The engagement has
been resumed, so that your interests are safe
as far as Luis Kingsley is concerned. You
seem to forget how much you owe me on that
score, for the moment I am the wife of L. P.
you can bring forward the proof that you
have discovered, and you may be sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
you will get your part of the money. Trust
me for that. If L. P. should hear anything
of this, I mean so far as you are concerned,
my chances with him would be dough. I
send the money that you requested.</p>

"E. C."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It did not require the initials to tell Neil
who the writer was.</p>

<p>He remembered to have heard the name of
Luis Kingsley before, but it was impossible
for him to remember in exactly what connection;
therefore, he pocketed the letter, and
finding nothing further, he turned to Mauprat.</p>

<p>He shook him roughly by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Say, are you dead, or what's the matter
with you?" he demanded. "Won't you ever
wake up?"</p>

<p>Ben raised his bleared eyes, and lifted himself
upon his elbow.</p>

<p>"Who in thunder are you?" he inquired
sleepily.</p>

<p>"I'm Bob Wells," answered Lowell coolly.</p>

<p>"Well, who's Bob Wells? I never saw you
before."</p>

<p>"But that is no reason why you'll never
want to see me again. Say, do you want to
find that girl that played detective in the
house where the Chandlers live?"</p>

<p>That was quite enough to arouse Ben Mauprat
on the instant.</p>

<p>"What do you know of her?" he asked,
rising and looking as straight as his half-drunken
eyes would allow into the boy's
face.</p>

<p>"Never mind what I know. I asked if you
wanted to find her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"How bad?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to know bad enough to
tell me what I want to know?"</p>

<p>"Tell me first what it is."</p>

<p>"I want to know what Luis Kingsley has
done with the money that belongs to Lynde
Pyne."</p>

<p>"Now what in thunder do you know about
that?"</p>

<p>"More than I am going to let you know.
Say, look a-here, Ben! You don't know me,
but I do know you mighty blamed well. I'll
just tell you who I am, as a pointer. I was
Lynde Pyne's office-boy, but he discharged
me fur&mdash;&mdash; Well, never mind what fur, I
got the bounce, jist the same. A feller can't
starve, and I have got to do jist that or git
some money. Now I propose to help you if
you will help me. Is it a go?"</p>

<p>"Hold, one minute! I don't know what
you are talking about."</p>

<p>"'Tain't necessary fur you to know. All I
say is that I know Luis Kingsley has got some
money that belongs to Lynde Pyne. I know
you know all about it. Do the square act on
the divy about what you git out of it, and I
will tell you all I know about that Cuyler
girl."</p>

<p>Mauprat had opened his mouth to reply,
when a violent pull at the bell interrupted
him. Breathlessly he waited, and with apparently
careless indifference, Neil waited
also.</p>

<p>At the expiration of a few seconds, the
door was opened by the woman who admitted
Neil.</p>

<p>"There is some one to see you in the other
room," she said to Mauprat.</p>

<p>By her manner, both her hearers knew as
perfectly well who she meant as though she
had spoken the name, but before either had
time to think upon the subject at all, a heavily
veiled woman pushed by her and entered
the room.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you, and have not time to
wait!" she began; then paused suddenly.</p>

<p>Neil could feel the eyes through the veil
fixed upon him piercingly.</p>

<p>He stood the test well, but started slightly
as the long-gloved finger was pointed at him.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" demanded Miss Chandler,
in the stoniest voice that Neil ever remembered
to have heard.</p>

<p>"He is Bob Wells, a former office-boy of
Lynde Pyne's," answered Mauprat, hurriedly.
"I will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your 'office boy of Lynde Pyne's,' is
Leonie Cuyler!" cried the young woman, excitedly.
"You must be mad that you could
not recognize her through that disguise!"</p>

<p>Mauprat uttered a low growl of rage.</p>

<p>Without a word, but showing his teeth like
a ferocious canine, he sprung forward and
caught Leonie by the throat.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>It required no great exertion of physical
force to bring the boy to his knees.</p>

<p>The breath was almost choked from his
body when Ben Mauprat released his hold.</p>

<p>"You cursed little imp of Satan!" he cried,
his voice hoarse from rage. "I'll teach you
to come here trying to impose upon me.
What in thunder do you mean by it? Answer
me quickly, or by Heaven! I'll strangle all the
life out of your little carcass. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you!" exclaimed Miss Chandler,
who had already removed the veil that covered
her face. "She has come here to play
the spy. She has threatened that unless I
break the engagement with Lynde Pyne&mdash;which
she has somehow discovered to exist&mdash;that
she will make known the secret of my
birth, and of my relationship to you. She is
here for the purpose of getting information
from you upon that subject."</p>

<p>"And perhaps I should have been fool
enough to have said something that might
have given it to her, if you had not come in
just when you did. So you want to break the
engagement that exists between Miss Chandler
and Lynde Pyne, do you?"</p>

<p>Leonie did not answer.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear me?" he screamed.</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes coldly to his face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard you," she answered, bravely.
"But I did not think it necessary to reply.
Your daughter has told you, and I thought it
useless to corroborate her words. But since
it seems that you require it, I may as well tell
you that I do not approve of her marriage to
Mr. Pyne, and it is my determination that if
such a thing is in the range of possibility, I
will prevent it!"</p>

<p>For a moment Ben Mauprat was stupid
from astonishment.</p>

<p>He stood with eyes and mouth both open,
gazing at the girl as if her audacity must be
the result of lunacy. Then he sprung forward
again.</p>

<p>She was too quick for him, however, and
before he could reach her, she had put the
rickety table between them.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" cried Miss Chandler, interrupting
the chase that she saw was imminent
"I have not time to wait for gymnastics of
that kind. Listen to me, and let us decide
what is to be done. It is dangerous to allow
lunatics their liberty, and that is what I think
Leonie Cuyler must be. No one else would
attempt the <i>role</i> that she has essayed. I think
therefore, that for the benefit of the public
she should be restrained! I suggest that you
keep her in confinement until after this wedding
shall have taken place, then&mdash;presupposing
of course that her physicians pronounce
her cured&mdash;she can be released. What
do you think of my plan? It seems to me to
be the only safe one!"</p>

<p>"We should be doing a public benefit!" exclaimed
Mauprat, his rage turned to mirth.
"I tell you, Evelyn, you are a chip of the
old block. It is a capital idea. I think while
she remains here as my patient that I may be
able to compensate her for the trouble she
took to sell me some information."</p>

<p>Leonie was aghast.</p>

<p>"I wish you would listen to me!" she cried
desperately. "I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is useless," interrupted Miss Chandler.
"I am quite convinced, and nothing she
could say would alter my idea, that the safest
thing&mdash;the only safe plan, in fact&mdash;is to confine
her until after the marriage. Then the
harm that she can do will be little enough,
for should she make known all the facts that
are in her possession, she would hurt no one
so much as the very man whom she has
risked so much to save&mdash;Lynde Pyne. I am
sure that you agree with me."</p>

<p>"I do, indeed."</p>

<p>"That is all that I came to see you for
to-day. I feel quite relieved that I know my
dear sister to be so well taken care of for the
present. She has given me a great deal of
concern during the last few weeks, but now
my mind will be at rest. Be sure that she
does not escape, and should you want to see
me about anything, send the message to the
old address. Do not risk coming to the house.
Good-bye! Do not allow anything to happen
to your precious patient."</p>

<p>With a mocking bow to Leonie she left the
room, and Ben Mauprat turned his entire attention
to Leonie.</p>

<p>He pointed to the door, and thinking that
she saw her opportunity, Leonie bowed courteously
and walked in the direction he indicated.</p>

<p>It led to the hall.</p>

<p>She had scarcely entered it, than, with a
quick bound, she reached the front door.</p>

<p>She would undoubtedly have made good her
escape, but that an unfortunate accident happened.</p>

<p>Some one had hold of the knob of the door
from the outside, and as she pulled it from
within, and some one pushed it from without,
it came open with a sudden force that caused
her to lose her footing, and she fell headlong.</p>

<p>Mauprat was upon her before she could recover
herself, had caught her by the shoulder,
and set her upon her feet.</p>

<p>His face was ghastly with rage.</p>

<p>"You infernal little fiend!" he panted, the
oaths falling thick and fast, "I'll give you
now a taste of the punishment that will come
from that sort of thing if you try it in the
future!"</p>

<p>He raised a heavy walking-stick and
brought it down again and again upon the
frail shoulders with terrible force.</p>

<p>The woman and the miserable hunchback
boy who had caused the accident, stood
shrinking back in the corner as far as possible,
ghastly with fear, until unable to stand it
longer, the woman caught the man's arm and
held it in a grasp like iron.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she cried hoarsely, "You don't
know what you are doing! She is not used to
that sort of thing, and you will kill her!"</p>

<p>Mauprat turned to the woman with a savage
growl.</p>

<p>He released his hold upon Leonie, who fell
without a groan to the floor.</p>

<p>"Take what your interference warrants!"
he cried, bringing the stick down with renewed
force upon the body of the woman.</p>

<p>She took it without a moan, the boy covering
his miserable face with his hands.</p>

<p>Finding that he could cause no outcry
of pain upon her part, Mauprat turned sullenly
to Leonie.</p>

<p>"She has fainted," he said, kicking the inert
body with his foot. "Carry her up-stairs
and put her in Dick's room. We'll see how
she succeeds with her next attempt at escape."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p>"Thompson, see if Mr. Lowell has returned
yet."</p>

<p>The order was given by Mr. Pryor to the
servant whom he had summoned by ringing
the bell in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The young people of the family, together
with their guests, Miss Pyne and Lynde, were
there, and each one glanced in some surprise
at the speaker when the order was
given.</p>

<p>He had seemed preoccupied and worried
during the entire evening, and now as eleven
o'clock came and still no signs of the missing
secretary, alarm took the place of anxiety.</p>

<p>There was not a question asked until the
return of the servant, but an ominous silence
was preserved.</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired Mr. Pryor as he returned.</p>

<p>"He is not in his room, sir, nor has he been
seen by any of the servants."</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Lowell disappeared?" asked Miss
Pryor, some concern expressed in her tone.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered her father. "It is a
most singular thing. He has never gone out
before to remain longer than an hour. He
knew that I should want him about a matter
of some importance to-night and yet he has
not come in. I don't understand it."</p>

<p>Every eye was leveled in his direction and
not toward Lynde Pyne, or they might have
observed his sudden pallor, and the expression
of absolute terror that had grown in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lowell is fully competent to take care
of himself," laughed Mrs. Pryor. "You will
make a perfect baby of that boy, Andrew,
and destroy in him the very characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
that you have so much admired. Eleven
o'clock is not late in New York."</p>

<p>"It is for Lowell. He has no friends here;
he is not accustomed to going out; he did not
mention that he should be gone for any
length of time, and furthermore, he knew
that I should need him very particularly to-night.
The whole thing in a nutshell is, that
it is not like Lowell, and I am convinced that
something has happened. If he is not here
within half an hour I shall be sure of it."</p>

<p>To the surprise of all, Lynde Pyne arose.
His face was deadly white, his lips quivering
with dumb anxiety.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Mr. Pryor!" he exclaimed.
"Something must have occurred
out of the ordinary to keep him out so late.
Have you any idea where he was going?"</p>

<p>"No. Had he been gone longer I should
say notify the police; but they would take
little interest in the case now, as he has been
gone so short a time, particularly as they
know nothing of the regular habits of the
boy. I suppose the only thing is to wait until
to-morrow morning; then, if he has not come
home, we must take every means in our
power to find him."</p>

<p>Lynde accepted the invitation that Mr.
Pryor extended to him to remain over night,
and the following morning descended to
breakfast without ever having removed the
clothing that he had worn the night before.</p>

<p>"You have heard nothing yet?" he inquired
of Mr. Pryor, almost before they had greeted
each other.</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>The answer confirmed his fears.</p>

<p>Something had happened, but what, it was
impossible to determine.</p>

<p>He left Mr. Pryor to make what search he
deemed advisable, and going to his own home
long enough to change his clothes, called
upon Miss Chandler.</p>

<p>He had not the remotest idea what he intended
to say to her, and the position in which
he found himself placed was a decidedly unpleasant
one.</p>

<p>"How pale you look!" exclaimed Miss
Chandler, offering him her lips to kiss.</p>

<p>It was an exceedingly cold caress that fell
upon them, but if she felt it, she made no
sign.</p>

<p>"I don't think I am quite well. I did not
sleep last night."</p>

<p>"Has anything happened?"</p>

<p>"Not directly to me; but it concerns some
friends of mine, who were terribly upset; and
as I was with them, naturally I shared their
anxiety."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"A mysterious disappearance of a member
of the family. It is really a most extraordinary
thing! The person I refer to is Miss
Leonie Cuyler!"</p>

<p>He was looking directly at Miss Chandler
as he spoke, in fact had not removed his eyes
from the handsome face since his entrance.</p>

<p>She started perceptibly, but recovered herself
with suspicious promptness.</p>

<p>"You surprise me!" she said, coolly. "I
did not know that Miss Cuyler had been found
since her other mysterious disappearance. It
seems that she has a <i>penchant</i> for disappearances.
One could almost get used to them,
they occur so frequently."</p>

<p>"This is different from that. She had no
reason for it, none earthly, and I cannot understand
it!"</p>

<p>"It seems to me that you are curiously interested
in Miss Cuyler!"</p>

<p>"I am! She seems to be a young woman
who is bearing the burden of the wrong doing
of some one else."</p>

<p>Miss Chandler's face flushed dully.</p>

<p>"It is a subject upon which I have given
no thought," she replied, coldly.</p>

<p>"Somehow I hoped that she might have
come to you."</p>

<p>A pallor crept about the full lips that Pyne
was not slow to see.</p>

<p>He was aware also of the sudden tightening
of the hands about a paper-cutter that she had
taken up, and of the quick, questioning glitter
that came to her eyes, to fade almost at once
under the restraint that she was putting upon
herself.</p>

<p>"To me?" she repeated, frigidly. "I fail
to see why you should have thought that. I
scarcely knew Miss Cuyler."</p>

<p>"But you interested yourself in her once.
She might have thought that you would
again."</p>

<p>"I had really forgotten her. What I did
was not interest, but humanity. She would
never have come to me for anything."</p>

<p>The very manner of the utterance of the
words convinced Pyne that she had been
there, and that Miss Chandler, his handsome
<i>fiancee</i>, knew more of the disappearance than
she proposed to tell.</p>

<p>What was the secret that linked those two
together, and what had Miss Chandler done
with the young woman who seemed to possess
some secret that she was determined to
have concealed?</p>

<p>He knew that he could discover nothing
further from her. He knew that inquiry
would bring forth no further information, and
that the only possible hope of ascertaining
was to wait and watch.</p>

<p>He must secure the co-operation of a clever
detective, and with the assistance that he
could lend, he hoped for the best.</p>

<p>His manner to Miss Chandler was affectionate,
as usual, though there was never any
particular amount of demonstration.</p>

<p>He felt that whatever the nature of his discoveries
might be, they would not release him
from his obligation, so that what he was doing
was because of his love for Leonie and the fact
that humanity demanded it.</p>

<p>As soon as consistency with his former
habits would allow, he left the residence of
his <i>fiancee</i>, fully convinced that there was a
deadly secret, and determined that, for the
sake of the innocent woman, he would
fathom it.</p>

<p>"You seem in some way to have changed
to me of late, Lynde," she said to him as he
was leaving. "I feel that you are growing
away from me. I am afraid that I destroyed
my own chances for happiness upon that day
that I forgot the modesty of my sex, and went
to your office to plead with you for what I
could not allow to be wrested from me without
a struggle. I loved you, Lynde, and felt
that to lose you would be worse than death.
You do not despise me for my unwomanliness,
do you? You will never forget the promise
that you made to me on that day?"</p>

<p>"I will never forget that promise, Evelyn.
You may be sure of that. You must not think
that your act that day caused you to fall in
my esteem. A woman loses none of the
beauty of her sex because she loves. My
promise is yours, and there is nothing that can
release me from it but death."</p>

<p>She kissed him and let him go.</p>

<p>As the door closed upon him, she turned
away with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Fool!" she muttered. "He will keep his
word, and under any circumstances I am
safe."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>"Liz! Liz!"</p>

<p>The call had to be repeated many times before
it met with an answer, and even then it
came faintly and broken by sobs.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Has Ben gone out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, curse him!"</p>

<p>"Won't you come in awhile? It is terrible
in this horrible darkness alone. Don't cry,
Liz. Come and tell me what he has done to
you."</p>

<p>"It ain't to me. God knows I would bear
it and say nothing if it was only me; but it is
Dick, poor little Dick, and I am afraid he has
killed him."</p>

<p>"Open the door, Liz. Let me help you in
some way. I swear to you that I will not try
to escape."</p>

<p>The woman arose and threw it open, allowing
the girl in the rags of a boy to come from
that pit of darkness into the light.</p>

<p>"I would not care much if you did escape!"
she exclaimed dully. "He would kill me
then, and I think I would be happier if he
did. Look there."</p>

<p>She pointed to the child who lay upon a pile
of straw on the floor, the miserable little
hunchback who had unconsciously prevented
Leonie from leaving there upon the night of
her imprisonment.</p>

<p>"He has killed him," continued the woman,
her voice filing passionately. "Last night
when the poor child came in he was sick, so
sick that he could scarcely drag his misshapen
body after him. Ben told him to do something,
and Dick did not get up as quick as
Ben thought he ought, and he gave him a
terrible beating. This morning the poor boy
was so sick that he could not get out of his
bed. I begged Ben to let him alone, but the
more I begged the more determined he became.
Dick got up, and as he did so, staggered
against the wall and fell; then Ben,
who swore it was nothing but laziness, got
the cowhide, and the poor body is black and
blue from the marks upon it. Oh, if God
would but strike him dead, how much good
it would do us all!"</p>

<p>"Why do you live with him, Liz? Why do
you not run away?"</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked bitterly. "Where
would I go? What would I do? Besides, he
would find me and he would kill me. You
don't know Ben as I do. He is not the only
man in the world that cares nothing for his
wife and yet forces her to live with him, because
the devil in his nature tells him that it
is a good way to torture her. I don't go because
I am afraid, like a thousand other poor
women who inhabit the world. Some day I
know that I shall kill him. If he would confine
his beatings to me, I might endure it, but
when he treats Dick in the way that he does,
there will come a time when the worm will
turn, and I, who have been trampled upon,
will become a fiend of his own creating."</p>

<p>Leonie had turned away from the woman's
passionate agony, and had lifted the little
form that lay upon its rude bed in her arms.</p>

<p>The child groaned and shrunk back as
though expecting a blow, and a hot tear fell
upon his flushed cheeks as he saw the compassionate
face bent above him.</p>

<p>Leonie laid her cool hand upon his burning
brow, and in a soothing voice said:</p>

<p>"What pains you, Dick? Tell me, dear,
and perhaps there may be something that I
can do for you! Don't be afraid. There is
nothing to hurt you now."</p>

<p>He lifted his scorching hand and laid it
upon her face. His lips trembled so that articulation
was almost impossible, but he managed
to make her understand the words:</p>

<p>"My throat!"</p>

<p>For one moment she shrunk from him, but
in the next he was lifted in her arms. She
sat in a chair rocking him to and fro.</p>

<p>"Liz," she cried, excitedly, "you must go
for a doctor at once&mdash;at once, do you hear?&mdash;or
the child will die! He has scarlet-fever or
diphtheria, one of the two&mdash;I am not doctor
enough to know which!"</p>

<p>A wild terror leaped to the woman's face,
but she did not move.</p>

<p>"I can't!" she gasped. "Ben would kill
me for leaving you here alone, and he would
kill Dick because I loved him enough to risk
it. Oh, my God, what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Go for the doctor, quick!" commanded
Leonie, "Ben can think that I was locked
up, for I swear to you that I will make no attempt
to escape. If he undertakes to hurt
Dick when he comes home I will find a way
to prevent him if I get killed myself for it!
Oh, Liz, go! Is it possible that you can stop
to think of anything when this poor child is
dying?"</p>

<p>"Dying! dying!" repeated the unhappy
woman, in an awe-stricken voice. "Now,
God hear my vow! If he dies I will kill the
man that has caused it, I swear it! He has
wrecked my life, he has made me what I am,
and I will end it all in a fitting manner. Oh,
Dick! Dick!"</p>

<p>She snatched up a scarf and wrapped it
about her head, dashing down the steps and
out the door with the speed of the wind.</p>

<p>She did not pause even to secure the door
behind her, but seemed almost to fly along
until she had reached the office of a doctor.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she gasped. "It is Dick, and he
is dying!"</p>

<p>The medical man knew nothing of who
Dick was, but the manner of the woman was
impressive to the last degree.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he cried. "What is the matter
with him? I must know, in order to take
what I may need."</p>

<p>"God knows what!" replied Liz, her expression
indicating insanity. "I think Ben has
killed him!"</p>

<p>The doctor waited for nothing further.</p>

<p>He snatched his hat, and without a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
followed the woman as she rushed along in
silence to her own home.</p>

<p>The door was ajar. She pushed it open and
led the way up the stairs.</p>

<p>There was Leonie, as she had left her, rocking
the child to and fro in the dilapidated
chair, and singing to him a little song that
she might lull him to sleep.</p>

<p>The eyes of the unfortunate mother filled
with tears as they fell upon the tableau.</p>

<p>She touched the short crop of curling hair
so lightly with her lips that Leonie did not
feel it, but it rested there like a benediction.</p>

<p>The doctor took the slight wrist in his hand,
and counted the pulse, then he looked at the
sploched tongue.</p>

<p>"Why did you tell me that this child had
been killed by some one?" he demanded of the
woman. "He has a terrible case of malignant
diphtheria."</p>

<p>Brave as she was, Leonie's face became
ghastly.</p>

<p>With awful horror, Liz crept closer to the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Will he die?" she asked, in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to say, though the chances
are largely against him. It will depend a great
deal upon his nursing. You should have another
woman to assist you."</p>

<p>Then the nobility of Leonie's nature asserted
itself.</p>

<p>"I will do that, doctor," she said gently.</p>

<p>"But you are a boy, and they are careless.
He will need attention day and night."</p>

<p>Leonie colored.</p>

<p>"I think you will find me a capable nurse
and a devoted one," she answered gently.</p>

<p>"Then to you I will give the instructions,
for the mother seems incapable of understanding."</p>

<p>Very carefully he went over everything
that she was to do in detail, telling her that
perhaps upon her the life of the child depended,
then took his leave, promising to call
again later in the day.</p>

<p>"Liz," Leonie said, when she was again
alone with the mother and her unfortunate
child, "you must go at once and get what
the doctor has prescribed. You need not fear
but that I will take the best care possible of
Dick."</p>

<p>"Malignant diphtheria!" whispered the poor
woman, as she took the paper from the girl's
hand. "And Ben beat him when he was
dying! God forgive him, for I never can!"</p>

<p>She left the room mumbling some words to
herself, words that seemed to proceed from a
breaking heart; but Leonie scarcely knew
that she had gone before she returned.</p>

<p>The medicine was prepared; but with all
his frail strength the child resisted, until
Leonie bent her tender head and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Won't you take it for me, Dick?" she
whispered. "It will make you well, dear,
and then there will be such fun for you and
me. Don't you want to be well for poor
mamma's sake?"</p>

<p>He turned his head without a word and
did as she bade him, his suffering terrible to
witness. Then pressing his head gently down
upon her shoulder, Leonie rocked him until
he slept.</p>

<p>Liz watched in a silence that was pitiful.
Crouched down where she could listen to the
slow tones of the soothing voice, she watched,
hoped a little, and perhaps prayed.</p>

<p>"Had you not better lay him down?" she
whispered, when quite sure that he slept.</p>

<p>Leonie shook her head.</p>

<p>"The bed is too hard," she answered.
"Poor little thing, it will not hurt me to hold
him."</p>

<p>"But you may take the disease yourself."</p>

<p>"One must always take that risk. I am
willing if I can be of service to him now."</p>

<p>"God bless you!" whispered Liz. "I'll
find a way to repay you for this if I am killed
for it. I can never forget that you might
have escaped and would not because of me
and my poor child. You are free to go now
if you wish."</p>

<p>"And leave you to face Ben Mauprat with
that child? No! my liberty would be sweet
to me, but I could not purchase it at such a
cost to you."</p>

<p>Liz lifted her eyes blinded with tears. She
kneeled and kissed the hand that supported
Dick's head.</p>

<p>"You are an angel!" she whispered. "I
had a daughter once, long years ago that
might have been like you if she had lived, but
she died years ago. That was the cause of
Ben's deserting me and running away for all
those years when I was little more than a girl
myself. Perhaps it would have been better
for me if he had never come back!"</p>

<p>A puzzled expression crossed Leonie's face.</p>

<p>"How long have you and Ben been married?"
she asked, not forgetting in her excitement
to speak sufficiently low not to disturb
the sleeping child.</p>

<p>"More than thirty years ago. He deserted
me and married another woman, but she
could not have been his wife, because I was
that. Then she died and he came back to
me."</p>

<p>Leonie could scarcely control her agitation.</p>

<p>"You say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But before she could complete the sentence,
the door opened and Ben Mauprat was in the
room.</p>

<p>With a low cry of horror, Liz sprung to her
feet, and at the same time the eyes of the
child opened. He shrunk further into
Leonie's arms, seeming to entreat her protection.
She clasped him closely and awaited
coming events.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>As though paralyzed by the audacity of the
situation, Ben Mauprat stood there regarding
the three.</p>

<p>Not a single word was spoken, and for
seemingly an interminable time a silence that
was painful rested upon them; then, with a
snarl of vengeance, he stepped forward, his
hand extended as though to snatch the boy
from Leonie's arms, but quicker than thought
Liz had placed herself between them.</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Ben," she cried hoarsely.
"I've been a good wife and a true one to you,
but you must not carry this any further than
you have. God knows I do not know how it
can be, but I have loved you with the devotion
that few women have shown the husbands
who have treated them with love and
tenderness, and I have had nothing but blows
and curses in return. I have never opened
my mouth against it, and I never shall, if you
kill me; but you have done your last to Dick.
Listen, Ben; he is dying. Do you hear? Dying,
Ben, and you are the cause of it. That
girl whom you beat, and almost killed, has
more love for your own child than you have,
for she gave the liberty that she might have
secured for his sake; and as there is a God
above us, I will protect her with my life! I
have been a coward just as long as I shall.
As far as I am concerned I am willing to bear
anything, but for Dick's sake the end has
come."</p>

<p>There was a dramatic intensity about the
situation that was thrilling.</p>

<p>The woman's tone was not loud, but her
arm was raised until she seemed to tower
above Ben Mauprat like a giantess above a
dwarf.</p>

<p>Her eyes glowed with the passion that was
moving her, her very bosom seemed to swell
until it threatened bursting.</p>

<p>The last words of her sentence were given
a force that caused Leonie to almost rise to
her feet.</p>

<p>"Stand out of the way!" exclaimed Mauprat
slowly, his eyes glowing with rage. "I
don't want to kill you."</p>

<p>"You may do it and welcome if you wish,"
exclaimed Liz, vehemently, "but you shall
not kill my child! Do you hear that, Ben?
He may not live an hour through the cruelty
that you have already shown him, but that
hour shall be passed in peace. You beat him
last night and again this morning, and ten
minutes ago the doctor told us that it would
be nursing and chance alone that could save
his life, and that chance he shall have! Don't
go near him, Ben! Don't try it! I love him
as the only thing that holds me to life. Without
him there is nothing in all this world that
makes it worth living, and as long as I can I
will keep him with me. You made him a
hunchback, you have robbed him of every
hope, but you shall not take the few hours
that remain to him. I beg that you will listen
to me, for if you refuse, as surely as you
take a step in his direction, I will kill you."</p>

<p>There was a hideous emphasis upon the last
words that would have told a man more of a
believer in the vengeance of a woman, that
the worm had turned at last.</p>

<p>But Ben Mauprat was not a believer in that
sort of thing. Once a coward, always a
coward to him.</p>

<p>He laughed fiendishly.</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, Liz, you are almost as
good as a play!" he cried brutally. "If it
were not setting a bad example I would excuse
you for what you have done, on account
of the amusement you have afforded me, but
I am afraid that if I did that, the next thing
you would do would be to allow this girl who
has won your heart through her attention to
that brat, to escape, and so ruin all my
chances for wealth. The young one has always
stood between me and your obedience!
He has caused you to oppose my will oftener
than anything else. He has caused you to
get numberless beatings, and therefore the
very best thing that could happen to you as
well as to me, would be to have him die. I
am not going to kill him outright, but I am
going to show you that I will stand none of
your rebellion, and that I will listen to none
of your threats. I am going to lock that
dangerous little rebel up, to settle with her
later, and then I am going to give the boy
the beating that his mother deserves."</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Ben! He has malignant
diphtheria, and he would but die under it!"</p>

<p>The words were spoken in an awe-struck
whisper, but they only seemed to anger the
man the more.</p>

<p>"Malignant diphtheria, has he?" he exclaimed,
harshly. "Well he may give it to
the rest of us, and the best thing that can be
done is to put him out of the way. Don't
give us any more lip, Liz, but stand aside!"</p>

<p>He put out his hand to compel her obedience,
but she only caught it, and held him
convulsively.</p>

<p>"Don't, Ben!" she cried, wildly. "For the
love of God have mercy! I have never asked
many things of you, and I beg this as I would
not plead for my own life! Oh, Ben, have
mercy!"</p>

<p>"I am tired of this now! Shut up, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ben, remember how true I have been.
Remember&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me go, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Ben, have pity! I swear that it is the last
favor that I shall ever ask!"</p>

<p>For all answer he gave her a terrible fling,
that sent her spinning across the room.</p>

<p>With a single stride he reached Leonie.</p>

<p>In another instant it is not to be doubted
that he would have snatched the already dying
child from her arms, but the desperate
mother again interfered.</p>

<p>She did not fall, but maddened by her fear
for the little, unfortunate creature in which
was centered her only love, her only happiness,
she seized a stick of wood that lay near
the stove on the floor, and as Ben would have
snatched the child from its helpless protector,
she brought the cudgel down upon the back
of his head with a force that, for a woman of
her build, was supernatural.</p>

<p>Without a word or even a moan he fell forward
upon his face and lay there like one
dead.</p>

<p>A look of horror, somewhat tempered with
relief, passed over Leonie's face.</p>

<p>But Liz seemed suddenly converted into a
maniac.</p>

<p>A shrill laugh fell from her lips, but almost
before it reached the atmosphere, it was
changed to a cry.</p>

<p>She flung herself upon her knees before the
boy and took his little, burning hand in hers,
pressing her hot lips upon it wildly.</p>

<p>"I have killed him!" she whispered, hoarsely.
"Do you hear that, my darling? I have
killed him, and in a moment they will come
to take your mother away to hang her. But
you must not fret, Dick. I knew that it
would come sooner or later, and it has come
now, but you must not let it worry you, my
darling. Oh, Dick! Dick! Dick!"</p>

<p>The words faded into a sob that was terrible.</p>

<p>Leonie laid her hand upon the bowed head
gently.</p>

<p>"Think what you are doing, Liz," she said,
almost tenderly. "The child is very ill&mdash;dying,
perhaps, and you are exciting him like
this. For his sake, calm yourself, Liz, and
listen to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Calm!" echoed the poor woman, as though
that were the only word that she had heard.
"How can I be calm when I have killed my
husband and my child is dying? Oh, girl, do
you know what that means to me? Have you
any idea what it means to be all alone in the
world with a weight like that upon your conscience?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" cried Leonie, earnestly. "You
have not killed Ben. You have only stunned
him, and if he returns to consciousness to
find us still here, I would not give much for
any of our lives. Do you hear me, Liz? Do
you not see the necessity of our taking Dick
away before he returns to life?"</p>

<p>For the first time the woman seemed to be
aroused.</p>

<p>She lifted herself and looked wildly about
her.</p>

<p>"You are right!" she exclaimed hoarsely.
"He may not be dead&mdash;child, it would be
better if I had killed him, for when he
awakens he will kill us all. What shall we
do? Help me to think! My brain seems to
be on fire!"</p>

<p>"Is there no one whom you know to whom
we could go for protection?"</p>

<p>"With him?" cried Liz, pointing to the
child. "You must be mad. Do you think
any one is going to risk a disease like that
for his sake or mine? There is nothing that
we can do, but you can go. There is no
reason that you should die because we must."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am such a coward that
I would leave you here alone? I would
rather die with you. No, Liz! If one of us
must remain we must all do so, but&mdash;I have
an idea, Liz. It is a hopeless situation for
you anyway, and therefore, it cannot be any
worse. Every moment may be precious to us
now, and therefore, we must act quickly. We
must call upon the police for protection. We
must have an officer here and have Ben arrested
when he awakens."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no time to argue it, Liz. It is a
last resort."</p>

<p>"Then you go. I will keep the child."</p>

<p>"No. I must remain. If he were to
awaken and find you here without me, he
would kill you without the hesitation of a
second; but if he should recover during your
absence, I could invent some story that would
keep him talking until your return. Do not
fear for me, Liz, but, for God's sake, hurry!"</p>

<p>For only one second Liz paused; then, with
not a glance in the direction of the prostrate
man, she murmured a word of blessing upon
the head of the girl who had, at the risk of
her own life, befriended her, and hastened
away.</p>

<p>With a heart that seemed to stand still with
dread, Leonie awaited.</p>

<p>Only once she looked at the child. The
great eyes were fixed pleadingly upon her, as
though beseeching her not to forsake him.</p>

<p>She pressed her hand over them, to close
the burning lids.</p>

<p>"Don't fret, Dick!" she said. "Nothing
shall harm you, my poor little one, until I
have been killed first."</p>

<p>The sound of her own voice, in the terrible
stillness that had fallen upon them, was uncanny.
She shivered with fright.</p>

<p>She turned from the unfortunate child, and
cast a look of dread upon the man beside her,
and, to her horror, found the hideous, glaring
eyes fixed upon her.</p>

<p>She could not prevent a little shriek of terror.
She watched him as though fascinated,
while very slowly he arose to his feet, never
once removing his terrible, glassy eyes from
her face.</p>

<p>It seemed ages until he had gained his feet,
and after he had, he still stood glaring at her,
slowly rolling up his sleeves in a manner that
seemed to paralyze her with horror.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>Like a bird that is magnetized into inactivity
by the movements of a snake, Leonie sat
and watched Ben Mauprat.</p>

<p>Slowly, and showing his teeth in a hideous
manner that was peculiar to him, Ben continued
to approach, until within a few feet of
her he made a sudden spring.</p>

<p>How it was that she escaped him she could
never have told, but she became conscious
that she had leaped by him, and was standing
a few feet away holding the child who was a
heavy burden in spite of his being a physical
wreck.</p>

<p>But she forgot it. She did not even remember
in her fright that she had him in her
arms, but stood there clasping him closely to
her, panting with terror.</p>

<p>The man turned toward her again, but before
he had advanced many inches, she
seemed to realize the necessity for immediate
action, knowing but too well that his next attempt
would not be attended with failure.</p>

<p>Hastily she laid Dick in an old ragged
chair and placed herself before it. With cold
defiance she lifted her handsome head.</p>

<p>"Now, Ben Mauprat," she cried, her voice
ringing out with clear determination, "I am
only a weak girl, but I am determined that
you shall not touch that boy, and if you do,
it shall be over my dead body. You may not
know it, but I was never one to threaten uselessly.
There is nothing in life that makes it
valuable to me, therefore there is no reason
why I should not keep my word. But for
your own sake listen to me a moment. I have
sent Liz out of the room. It will be utterly
useless for you to attempt to find her, but if
you harm me, she will hand you over to the
police within ten minutes. You will not have
a possible chance of escape. She is determined
that she will save the life of her child,
and she knows that upon mine his depends.
Now, Ben, listen to reason! You say that you
have a purpose to accomplish. You destroy
your chance of doing it, and send yourself to
the gallows."</p>

<p>She paused, her strength almost deserting
her. She was trembling in every limb, but
there was little evidence of weakness about
her. She seemed like a marble statue imbued
with life and unchangeable resolution.</p>

<p>"I shall not send myself to the gallows!" he
exclaimed, his eyes blood-shot, either from
the blow on the head, or his rage, Leonie
could not quite determine which. "I am
going to give that boy the beating that I have
promised him. I am going to give you one
for your interference in my affairs, and then
after that I shall settle with Liz, and before I
am through with her she will wish she had
never been born. Do you understand that,
young woman?"</p>

<p>"I understand that you are a very foolish
man who are risking your own neck to gratify
a miserable spirit of revenge. Ben, there was
a time when you were my mother's husband.
Because of that connection with one who
would have been dear to me had I been old
enough to know her, and who was the one
sacred thought of all my young life, I plead
with you to spare yourself the shame of dying
upon the scaffold!"</p>

<p>"You are talking like an idiot. I am a fool
that I have listened to you at all, but I am
through now. Stand from before that boy!
I shall settle with him first and you may come
after."</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>"What, defiance?"</p>

<p>"Anything that you choose to call it, but
I say determination. You shall not touch
him!"</p>

<p>"Once more, stand aside!"</p>

<p>"And again. I will not!"</p>

<p>"Then take the consequences!"</p>

<p>He strode toward her, his brutal face purple
with passion, his heavy fist clinched as
though to enforce obedience, but instead of
thinking of the words that she had been
speaking to him, Leonie had been making a
plan of action.</p>

<p>She was too busy thinking how she was to
save herself and the boy, whose life seemed
to depend upon her, to wonder at the continued
absence of Liz.</p>

<p>As she saw Ben coming to her, she sprung
aside for the moment, and almost before he
realized that she had moved, she was back
in her place before Dick again, a broken
pitcher filled with water, clasped firmly by
the handle in her hand.</p>

<p>As the man approached her, she pitched
the contents into his eyes.</p>

<p>With a growl of rage, Ben turned aside,
but only for an instant.</p>

<p>With the water still dripping from his face
and falling over his clothes, he made a desperate
spring upon Leonie!</p>

<p>She lifted the pitcher, and was about to
bring it down with all her force upon his
head, when the door suddenly opened and Liz
entered!</p>

<p>The woman took in the situation at a glance.</p>

<p>A low cry issued from her lips, and a single
word. It was:</p>

<p>"Quick!"</p>

<p>A man in the blue uniform and brass buttons
of a police officer sprung into the room.</p>

<p>With his fist poised in the air, Ben turned.</p>

<p>He understood what had happened, and
Leonie's meaning.</p>

<p>He fell back with an awful oath.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he demanded,
savagely. "This house is mine, and I command
you to get out of it!"</p>

<p>"I am going to do so at once," answered
the officer, serenely, "and you are going with
me!"</p>

<p>"I think you will miss your reckoning in
that!" answered Ben, bracing himself in a
manner that the officer understood at once to
mean fight.</p>

<p>The policeman lifted his club threateningly.</p>

<p>"I don't want to have to use any force
with you, my man," he said calmly, but with
every evidence of meaning precisely what he
said; "but if I must do so, you will find that
I know how to use a club with good effect.
This woman has sworn out a warrant for your
arrest. I have never been sent out yet for a
man that I did not take him back with me,
dead or alive, and I do not propose to make
you an exception to the rule. My record shall
remain unbroken. Now, are you ready to go
with me quietly, or must I use force?"</p>

<p>"You can use whatever you please," replied
Ben, looking over the man's shoulder at
Liz; "but before you do it, I have a little
debt to settle."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment as though considering,
then spoke to Liz:</p>

<p>"So I owe this to you, do I?"</p>

<p>"It was to save Dick's life, Ben," answered
the poor woman, hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, was it? Well, I hope, as you have
taken so much trouble to save it, you may
enjoy it. You have played the devil with
me, and I have never allowed any one to do
that yet without giving them what they deserved.
I am sorry that I have not time to
at least allow you one prayer, but it is impossible
on this occasion."</p>

<p>Almost before he had ceased speaking, he
had drawn a revolver from his pocket, and
pointing it at the woman's head, pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>Accustomed as he was to such scenes, the
officer had not contemplated such an act upon
the part of the man, but Leonie seemed to
understand perfectly what was coming.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the suggestion of fear, since
cowardice often makes one more wary than
the coolest bravery.</p>

<p>As the pistol was leveled, she threw out the
pitcher that she held and struck the man's
arm, sending it in an acute angle.</p>

<p>The bullet passed, perhaps, not two inches
above Liz's head, but, as the smoke cleared
away, Ben saw her standing there unharmed.</p>

<p>What he might have done to Leonie under
the circumstances can better be imagined
than described, but before he had an opportunity
to allow his fiendishness swing, he was
caught by the officer.</p>

<p>With a foul oath Ben turned upon him.</p>

<p>One blow from the revolver across the
man's head cut the flesh until the blood
streamed across his eyes, and the next instant
an escape might have been effected that
would have cost them all their lives, but that
Leonie seized the piece of wood that had
served Liz so well, and planted another blow
upon the back of Mauprat's head.</p>

<p>It did not stun him, but brought him to his
knees, giving the officer time to recover himself.</p>

<p>Before Ben had staggered to his feet, the
"bracelets" were slipped over his wrists, and
he found himself powerless.</p>

<p>Even then his efforts at escape did not
cease. He made a leap in the direction of
the fire-escape, but before he could reach it,
the burly hand of the officer had him in a
vise-like grip.</p>

<p>"If you try that again," he exclaimed
hoarsely, wiping the blood from his eyes with
the back of one hand, "I'll settle you with
this club! Do you understand me? I never
beat a man if I can help it, but when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
forces me into it, he never wants another
from the same source. Now come on!"</p>

<p>He gave Ben a jerk which nearly upset
him, but if he expected quiet yielding he was
mistaken.</p>

<p>Ben turned, even pinioned as he was, to
show fight, but a single blow from the club
was all that he required.</p>

<p>The officer jerked him to the window, and
throwing it up, put his head out and blew his
whistle shrilly.</p>

<p>With one hand grasping his club firmly
and the other Ben's collar, he waited.</p>

<p>It did not require many minutes until the
call for help was answered and the other officer
who had been summoned came up-stairs.</p>

<p>"I did not want to risk an escape," the
first man said by way of explanation. "He
is one of the toughest customers that I have
come across in many a day."</p>

<p>With one on either side they were leading
him away, when Ben turned to Liz.</p>

<p>"You have escaped me this time," he said
savagely, "but I will have my revenge, if I
am forced to break through prison walls to get
it. And as for you"&mdash;turning to Leonie&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shut up!" commanded the officer. Then
to the two women: "You need not be afraid.
He'll get a good long spell for this, and when
he gets out he won't be so fond of this sort
of thing. You need not let it worry you in
the least degree. Now come on, and mind
you step quickly."</p>

<p>The handling that he received was not of
the gentlest, and as the officer closed the door
behind him Liz crept up and touched Leonie
gently.</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"You must not fear," answered Leonie
bravely. "There are many things that we
both can do, now that there is no longer any
danger from him. But the first thing is to
attend to Dick, poor little Dick. You must
forget Ben, Liz, and remember only that Dick
needs you."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"You may be quite sure that I shall never
desert you while you want me. I have no
mother, Liz, no one on this earth any more
than you have, and after I have accomplished
my mission we will go away and live together,
if you wish, getting what happiness we can
out of the life that we shall make for ourselves."</p>

<p>"God bless you, my noble friend. I think
you have already saved me from a madhouse."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>A nebulous gleam of light from an almost
exhausted candle fell upon Leonie and Liz as
they sat silently in the room where Dick lay
in a disturbed slumber.</p>

<p>He had been placed upon the almost comfortable
bed that Ben Mauprat had used as
his exclusive resting-place, and appeared
more comfortable than they could have
hoped.</p>

<p>An old-fashioned clock upon the mantelpiece
tolled the hour of two, and, with a
shiver of horror and dread that she could not
control, Liz drew nearer to Leonie.</p>

<p>"You go to bed," she whispered in a tone
that would not disturb the child. "You
must be almost dead!"</p>

<p>"I am not in the least sleepy," answered
Leonie. "You go. You will need all your
strength to-morrow."</p>

<p>Liz shook her head.</p>

<p>"I couldn't sleep. I don't feel as if I ever
could again!" she answered, drearily.</p>

<p>"Then let us both sit up. I think he is
better, don't you?"</p>

<p>The question was asked with a nod of the
head to indicate Dick, and Liz glanced in his
direction eagerly.</p>

<p>"God knows I hope so," she said, with
some degree of color warming her pale cheeks.
"I should go mad if he died!"</p>

<p>"You must not say that, Liz. You must
not rebel against the will of the Lord. Why
should you wish to keep him here for your
sake, when your own reason must tell you
that it would be for his happiness to be in
Heaven?"</p>

<p>"You don't know what it is! You don't
know how alone I should be, and how I love
him!" cried the woman, passionately.</p>

<p>"Do I not?" answered Leonie, sadly.
"There was one to me as near almost as he
to you. I loved him with all the strength of
my nature, and I lost him. You may be sure
that you have a sympathy for me which only
a similar experience can bring."</p>

<p>"Tell me of it."</p>

<p>"I cannot. The wound is too new. Liz,
you told me that you were married to Ben
Mauprat thirty years ago, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And that he deserted you and married
another woman. Was there ever any divorce
that enabled him to do that legally?"</p>

<p>"No. He married her knowing that she
never could be his wife so long as I lived.
He was not then what he is now. You would
never believe that he was the same man, nor
me the same woman, for that matter. We
had a daughter that Ben was mad about. He
seemed to love her as he never loved anything
before or since, and she died. He
blamed me with her death, when my own
heart was breaking. He said that it was my
neglect that had killed her. We had a terrible
quarrel, he beat me and left me. I did
not hear anything more of him for years, then
one day I heard that he was married. I
searched for the truth and found it. He was
married to a young woman whose name was
Lena. I saw her, and I heard him call her
name. They had a child, a little girl, but
Ben never seemed to care for her as he had
done for our little one. I went to Ben and
tried to persuade him to come back to me,
but he only laughed at me. I did not tell the
poor young thing that he called his wife the
lie with which he had deceived her. What
would have been the good? It was too late
then to save her the disgrace that would have
been upon her, and she was a beautiful, delicate
girl. Soon after that Ben committed a
crime and was put in the penitentiary. Before
he was released she died. I knew that
the child had been adopted by some wealthy
people, but I never saw Lena again after
that night. The girl who told us who you
were was the child. She is his own daughter."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?" asked Leonie, endeavoring
to control her agitation.</p>

<p>"Of course I am! He has told me so
often."</p>

<p>"But is there no other proof than just his
words?"</p>

<p>"I have seen letters from her, making the
acknowledgment virtually."</p>

<p>"Have you them?"</p>

<p>"No, but I think I could find some of them
easily enough!"</p>

<p>"Liz, that girl is a thief!"</p>

<p>"I know it! Her own father made a thief
of her!"</p>

<p>"If it had not been in her naturally, he
could never have done it! She would have
died first! Do you think any one could ever
have made a thief of me?"</p>

<p>"That was why Ben broke Dick's back; because
the poor child refused to steal!"</p>

<p>"But Evelyn Chandler did not refuse, because
I saw her do it! Liz, the only man who
has ever stood my friend, the man to whom I
owe a debt that never can be paid, is engaged
to marry Evelyn Chandler, and I have sworn
to save him. There is but one way to do it,
and that is to prove her parentage, and the
crime that she has committed! God knows if
I could give my life and save Lynde Pyne, I
had rather do it, but that would do no good!
It would but insure the sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Lynde Pyne! Lynde Pyne, did you say?"
asked Liz, in a whisper, leaning excitedly
toward Leonie.</p>

<p>"Yes! What do you know of him?"</p>

<p>"Is not he the man who expected to be his
uncle's heir, but his uncle left all his money
to Luis Kingsley instead?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I think now that you
mention it that I have heard something of
that kind!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is who it is! Ben knows where
the will is that was made after the one that
gave Luis Kingsley the money. It gives
everything to Lynde Pyne! I have heard Ben
and his daughter speak of it frequently. They
had it planned that she was to marry Lynde
Pyne, and then the will was to be produced.
It makes him one of the wealthiest men in the
state."</p>

<p>"I see it all now."</p>

<p>"All what?"</p>

<p>"Very many things that I could not understand
before. Have you any idea where that
will is?"</p>

<p>"No. But it must be somewhere in Ben's
things, because the producing of it depended
upon him exclusively. His daughter wanted
it, but Ben would not let her have it. I am
not sure, though, whether it is here or in
Luis Kingsley's office."</p>

<p>"What did Ben have to do with him?"</p>

<p>"He made a pretense of working there, but
he was not in the office more than half an
hour during the week, and then only when
he wanted to be. Luis Kingsley knew that
Ben had him in his power, and he did not
dare oppose Ben. Ben played the respectable
because of his position down there."</p>

<p>"Liz, listen to me. You have said that you
owed me a debt of gratitude for what I did
for Dick to-night. For myself, Heaven
knows I would never ask anything of you,
but would be glad enough if there were anything
that I could do to make life more endurable
to you. But, Liz, there is another!
One who is as dear to me as life itself, and
for his sake I ask that you help me to prove
this. Help me to gain possession of that
will, to prove the unworthiness of Evelyn
Chandler, and I will stand by you and bless
you until life leaves me! Promise me that
you will do this, Liz."</p>

<p>"I promise with all my heart. I would do
it, even if I knew that I should never see you
again, for the kindness that you have already
shown my poor boy, and for which God will
surely bless you. I don't know exactly how
we are to find the will, but I do know about
the proof concerning Ben's daughter, and I
can get that for you before morning if you
want it."</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the sound of a
groan, and rising, Leonie glided noiselessly to
the bed. The boy was awake, and in his eyes
could be plainly seen the presence of death.</p>

<p>Leonie raised him in her arms. Her heart
ached for the grief that she knew the unfortunate
mother must endure, and in the
sympathy that was aroused she forgot her
own matters for the time.</p>

<p>"What is it, Dick?" she asked tenderly.
"Is there anything that you want?"</p>

<p>The suffering child tried to speak, but the
painful effort ended in a moan.</p>

<p>The glassy eyes wandered to Liz's face and
remained there as though in dumb pleading.</p>

<p>The woman came forward and knelt beside
him.</p>

<p>"Are you suffering, my boy?" she asked,
endeavoring to strangle the sobs that arose in
her throat.</p>

<p>He made a gesture of annoyance.</p>

<p>With all his frail strength he was striving
to say something, but the words died upon his
lips before a sound was articulated.</p>

<p>He beat the air with his small hands madly,
as though unable to bear it.</p>

<p>"Is it water that you want, dear?" asked
Leonie. "If so, nod your head!"</p>

<p>He shook it as vigorously as his weakening
strength would allow.</p>

<p>"Is it anything that you want?"</p>

<p>He indicated the negative. Another violent
effort was followed by the word:</p>

<p>"Will!"</p>

<p>"You mean that you know where the will
is?"</p>

<p>He nodded in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind it now, dear. That will
do when you are well and strong. Now you
must take the medicine that the doctor has
left, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" he gasped. "No use. Good-bye&mdash;mother.
It is all&mdash;over now, and he can't&mdash;beat
me&mdash;again. The will&mdash;is&mdash;in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He caught his throat with his hands and
seemed trying to tear the words from it, but
a fit of strangling ensued that was horrible.</p>

<p>"Go for the doctor, Liz. Quick!" cried
Leonie, ghastly with fear.</p>

<p>Dick put out his hand.</p>

<p>Once again he endeavored to speak, but it
was followed by one gulp that turned him
purple in the face.</p>

<p>Liz uttered a groan of anguish.</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes once pleadingly; then settled
himself back after a long sigh in Leonie's
arms.</p>

<p>For many moments she held him closely;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
then with an expression of terror, placed her
ear near his heart.</p>

<p>She lifted him tenderly and laid him back
upon the bed.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Liz, hoarsely. "Not&mdash;dead!"</p>

<p>Leonie laid her arms around the woman's
neck.</p>

<p>"Remember that he is with God," she said
gently. "In wishing to resist the will of
Heaven you wish to place him back here again
where&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was no need for the sentence to be
completed, for it would have been uttered to
deaf ears.</p>

<p>Liz had fainted.</p>

<p>Unconsciousness was the kindest thing that
Heaven could have sent, for it relieved her
for the time of the terrible grief of knowing
that she had lost the only being who held her
to life.</p>

<p>Utterly helpless and alone, Leonie left the
room, and running down-stairs, endeavored
vainly to find help, then went back feeling
that she could not leave the living and the
dead together under circumstances so ghastly
as those.</p>

<p>She hurried back to the room where she
had left them.</p>

<p>It was a piteous scene that greeted her.</p>

<p>Upon the floor Liz sat with the body of the
boy clasped to her breast, rocking him to and
fro while she sung to him the lullaby with
which she had soothed him to sleep in infancy.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered, lifting her finger
warningly as Leonie entered the room. "The
baby is asleep. He has not been well, and
you must not wake him."</p>

<p>Acting upon an impulse, Leonie sprung to
her side and took the child from her.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of?" she gasped.</p>

<p>But before she could lay the child upon the
bed, she felt ten long fingers close over her
throat from the back.</p>

<p>She endeavored to cry out, but they clung
all the more closely, closing tighter and
tighter until she was as helpless as the child
upon the bed.</p>

<p>Then for the first time she seemed to understand.</p>

<p>She was in the hands of a maniac.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>


<p>As the terrible thought came to Leonie,
with all its frightful import, she endeavored
to conceive some plan by which she could
save herself, knowing that upon the quickness
of her action alone depended her chance
of life.</p>

<p>And life never appears so intensely sweet
as when we are looking the loss of it squarely
in the face.</p>

<p>Yet what was she to do?</p>

<p>She knew that she had as well undertake to
move the fingers of a hand cast in iron as
those upon her throat.</p>

<p>It required not an instant of time for those
thoughts to flash briefly through her head,
but the time seemed ages to her strained
nerves.</p>

<p>Still, under all the excitement and horrors
of the night, her mind had never seemed so
clear, so perfectly capable of coping with
positions that appeared hopeless.</p>

<p>Endeavoring to restrain her breathing, so
that she could endure the choking as long as
possible, she threw a quick glance about her.
Within reach was the pistol that the officer
had torn from Ben's hand, and had, in his
subsequent haste, evidently forgotten.</p>

<p>She shuddered as she caught sight of it, but
at that moment the fingers resumed a closer
hold.</p>

<p>She gave herself a fierce wrench, and endeavored
to turn herself in the terrible grasp,
but she was like a piece of metal held by a
trip-hammer.</p>

<p>Under the strain of hideous necessity, she
put out her hand and grasped the revolver.</p>

<p>In it she saw the only hope of life, but what
a frightful hope it was! Still there was not
an instant to lose.</p>

<p>It seems to require a hundred words in cold
type to describe the action of a second, for
certainly it was not much longer than that
before the little weapon of death was clasped
firmly in Leonie's hands.</p>

<p>Unaccustomed as she was to the handling of
such instruments, and further affected by the
terror of the moment, her finger came first in
contact with the trigger.</p>

<p>It was self-acting, and before she realized
that it was really in her possession, there was a
frightful explosion, and the next moment she
felt the hands drop from her throat.</p>

<p>The concussion put the light out, and she
was in absolute darkness, with death and
lunacy!</p>

<p>It was not an enviable position, most particularly
as she had no idea of the extent of
the damage done by the pistol.</p>

<p>Her excitement was almost unbearable.</p>

<p>She turned in Liz's direction.</p>

<p>Even in the darkness she could not fail to
see the phosphorescent glare from the wild
eyes of the woman that glittered like those of
a cat.</p>

<p>With a quick dodge, Leonie passed her,
sprawling over a chair in the darkness, but
with the dexterity of mania Liz followed
her.</p>

<p>A chase ensued that for dramatic horror
could not be excelled, and yet, perhaps, the
interest was felt most by the participator who
was conscious of the terrible danger in which
she was placed.</p>

<p>She still had the revolver clasped in her
hand, being pretty sure that at least three
chambers were still full, but that was to be
used only as a last resort.</p>

<p>Then, to her surprise, Liz paused. She
could see her quite distinctly by the glare in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Liz," she said, gently, "don't you know
who I am? Why do you want to hurt me,
dear? I am Leonie! Leonie, whom Dick
loved, and who loves both you and him!
Don't you know that, Liz?"</p>

<p>The woman laughed hoarsely.</p>

<p>"You can't deceive me!" she answered in a
tone that was horrible. "You are Ben, and
you have come to beat my poor boy when he
is dying! But you shall not do it! Do you
hear that? I have been a good wife to you,
but it is ended now! You shall not beat my
child again, and in order to keep you from it,
I am going to kill you!"</p>

<p>"Listen to my voice, Liz, and let that convince
you that I am not Ben. Indeed you
are wrong, dear. Don't you know how we
were talking just now about the will that
was made, and you said that Ben knew where
it was? Don't you remember how poor little
Dick tried to tell us something about it? I
am Leonie, Liz; can't you understand that,
dear?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You are trying to deceive me, but you
can't do it."</p>

<p>"Then if I promise you that I will not touch
Dick!"</p>

<p>"You can't fool me; I knew you were Ben,
but you thought I would not recognize you in
the darkness. I am going to kill you, then I
am going to take my boy and go away where
no one will ever know. Oh, I have thought
of it often, often! I have all my plans made,
and when they find you they will never suspect
that I had anything to do with it. I
have always known that it would come to
this sooner or later, and I have thought many
times of how I would do it&mdash;just with this
long, thin knife that I have got in my hand.
It will go to your heart so easily that I don't
think that any one will ever see the wound
that it will make. I don't want to hurt you
any more than I can, for I used to love you,
Ben; but I am going to free Dick. Do you
hear, Ben? I hope you are ready to die, for
as there is a God your time has come!"</p>

<p>There in the darkness, with only those
glittering eyes visible, and the faintest outline
of her surroundings, even with a revolver
clasped in her hand, the position was
one of almost incalculable danger to Leonie,
who knew as little about a revolver as a
child.</p>

<p>Her teeth chattered with terror.</p>

<p>She saw the woman creeping toward her
again, and a wild desire to escape if the most
desperate chances were required, took possession
of her. Her heart seemed almost to stop
its beating.</p>

<p>She turned and fled, careless of direction,
and the next instant tripped over something,
tumbling to the floor with a crash!</p>

<p>The pistol flew from her hand.</p>

<p>Feeling that every moment was precious,
she groped about for it, but it was not to be
found. Then she felt the brush of a woman's
skirt over her.</p>

<p>Liz bent downward.</p>

<p>Leonie believed that her hour had come,
but with a last struggle for precious life, she
caught the woman's feet at the ankles and
upset her. The respite was only momentary.</p>

<p>She readily understood that an attempt to
cope with insanity was but another form of
madness, and leaping to her feet, she approached
the window.</p>

<p>Her resolve was desperate. She would
trust to a jump in preference to a lunatic.</p>

<p>Then at the last moment, Heaven seemed
to come to her rescue.</p>

<p>As she threw up the sash, she caught sight
of a rope that was attached to the sill, for
some purpose of Ben's own. Hastily securing
the end in a knot around her waist, she
sprung upon the sill and let herself down.</p>

<p>She did not pause to consider the danger.
It was alluring beside that which she had
but just escaped.</p>

<p>Down, down she went through the gloom
of the night into the street, but before she
reached the pavement, she felt a heavy hand
laid upon her.</p>

<p>Rough as the grasp was, it felt like the
hand of Heaven to her.</p>

<p>"You young rascal!" a voice exclaimed.
"What are you doing leaving a house in that
fashion in the dead of night?"</p>

<p>Leonie grasped the hand and shook it.
There were tears in her voice and in her eyes,
tears that were the result of hysteria.</p>

<p>"I have been fighting with a maniac," she
exclaimed, hastily. "For God's sake look!"</p>

<p>She had glanced up at the window through
which she had escaped, and as she did so the
street lamp showed her the figure of a woman
standing in it.</p>

<p>"Don't jump, Liz! Don't, for the love of
Heaven!" she shrieked, wildly. "You will
kill yourself! There is no rope to save you,
and there would not be a chance! Oh, Liz,
for God's sake go back!"</p>

<p>But the voice only seemed alluring to the
woman upon the sill.</p>

<p>She jumped from it back into the room,
and as Leonie thought she had listened to her
warning, she saw her appear there again
with something clasped in her arms.</p>

<p>Before the girl could open her mouth
through the horror upon her, there was a
wild scream of laughter, and the next moment
Liz had leaped into the air, with the
burden still held closely to her.</p>

<p>Breathless, ghastly with hideous fear, Leonie
grasped the hand of the man who stood
in silence beside her.</p>

<p>People in the neighborhood who had heard
the wild cry that the stillness of the night
made all the more shrill and fierce, put their
heads out of the window to see the cause, and
in a moment the street was crowded with
men, boys and even women, some drawing on
their coats and others not even taking that
precaution against the dampness of the night.</p>

<p>Then some one with more presence of mind
than the rest summoned an ambulance.</p>

<p>The police arrived, then the ambulance,
and with tenderness and care the woman and
child were placed within.</p>

<p>"Is she dead?" whispered Leonie to the ambulance
surgeon.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, kindly. "She is not
dead, but it might be kinder to her if she
were. The child is dead. Is she your mother,
my boy?"</p>

<p>It was the first time that Leonie had
thought of her clothes, and her face colored
slightly as she answered:</p>

<p>"No, sir, not my mother, but my friend!
Her husband was arrested to-night and taken
to jail for trying to kill her child. He died
of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the surgeon had no time for details.
It was necessary to get the woman to the
hospital as soon as possible, and giving the
address to Leonie, he gave the order to the
driver.</p>

<p>The man who had first arrived upon the
scene turned to Leonie.</p>

<p>"If you will come home with me," he said,
"I will see that you have a place to sleep to-night."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, sir," she answered,
"but I think I cannot go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"You do not mean that you will remain in
that house alone?"</p>

<p>But Leonie remembered the letters that she
must secure that night if ever, and replied
bravely:</p>

<p>"I shall not be afraid. There can be no
danger now. Good-night, sir, and thank
you."</p>

<p>She turned and left him, after taking his
address, and once more entered the house
where her experiences had been so alarming.</p>

<p>To a person of the strongest nerves the prospect
was not a pleasant one, but at least there
was nothing to harm her now.</p>

<p>With that consolation she entered the hall
and closed the door behind her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p>It was with no gentle touch that the officers
led Ben Mauprat to the station.</p>

<p>They had almost reached it when, as they
were turning a sudden corner, they were met
by a man&mdash;evidently a gentleman, from his
dress and appearance.</p>

<p>An expression of gladness lighted Ben's
features.</p>

<p>"You, Mr. Kingsley!" he exclaimed. "May
I have a word with you?"</p>

<p>The gentleman, handsome in appearance as
Apollo, paused.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mauprat?" he asked.</p>

<p>Then turning to the policemen:</p>

<p>"Not a drunk and disorderly, is it?"</p>

<p>"Worse than that, sir," answered the man
who had performed the arrest. "He tried to
kill his wife and child. Shot at her in my
presence."</p>

<p>"Why, how was that, Ben? You see, the
man is in my employ, and I am naturally interested
in him."</p>

<p>"Will you come to the station house with
us, sir, if there is anything you wish to ask?"
said one of them. "He has proven himself
a dangerous customer, as you can see by that
cut over my eye, and I want to get him locked
up before I am forced to crack his skull."</p>

<p>Luis Kingsley made a gesture of acquiescence,
and silently followed the lead of the
officers.</p>

<p>While the entry was being made, Mauprat
spoke aside to Kingsley.</p>

<p>"You had better bail me!" he said; "but
failing in that, there is a message that I want
you to take now&mdash;to-night, sure! There must
be no mistake about that, for upon it more
than you think depends. You must go to
Miss Evelyn Chandler, and tell her what has
happened to me. You must tell her that Liz
and Leonie Cuyler are at my house alone, and
that&mdash;I am afraid something will happen to
them."</p>

<p>"Where is it that you live?"</p>

<p>"She knows," replied Ben, curtly, "and
she will understand what I mean. Do you
think that you can get me out to-night?"</p>

<p>"The chances are that I cannot, particularly
as you resisted arrest."</p>

<p>"Well, don't let it be later than to-morrow.
Be sure that you deliver the message at once,
for upon it depends more than I can tell you.
You promise?"</p>

<p>"I do. Give me the address."</p>

<p>It was given and jotted down in the Russia
leather note-book that Luis Kingsley carried,
while Ben Mauprat was locked up.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingsley made no very strenuous efforts
to get bail accepted, but left the station-house
after ascertaining the exact charges
upon which Ben had been arrested. He
lighted a cigar and walked leisurely down the
street.</p>

<p>"Now, who is Miss Evelyn Chandler, and
what in thunder did he want me to deliver
that absurd message to her for?" he asked of
himself, mentally. "Hanged if I know
whether I ought to do it or not. If I only
knew where he lives, I don't think I should
bother about notifying Miss Chandler at all,
but as I don't, and the chances very decidedly
against me finding out, I had better keep
my promise. If Miss Chandler goes there, I
might follow her and thereby put myself in
possession of the papers with which that man
has so often threatened me. Let me see.
Why, this is the address of Leonard Chandler,
one of the wealthiest men in the city.
It can't be that this is his daughter to whom
Ben Mauprat has sent a message. It seems
to me that there is the promise of something
sensational here. At all events it is worth
following up. I most decidedly shall keep
my promise to Ben and call upon the young
lady."</p>

<p>There was no longer any hesitation on the
part of the young man, but hailing a passing
hansom, he leaped in, gave the address, and
went rolling over the cobble-stones as rapidly
as the bony horse could carry him.</p>

<p>He glanced up at the massive brown-stone
front, before which he was deposited, with
considerable surprise.</p>

<p>"What in the name of all that is wonderful
could Ben Mauprat have to do with a
young woman living in a house like this?" he
asked of himself.</p>

<p>Then a smile flitted over his features.</p>

<p>"She is one of the servants," he told himself.
"The name is one of those curious accidents
with which one often meets. I
wonder what the people will think of me for
presenting myself at their front door to inquire
for a servant? Well, if the worst comes
I can excuse myself on the plea of philanthropy.
Ha! ha! that is something after the
order of the devil quoting Scripture!"</p>

<p>He ran up the stoop and rang the bell
loudly.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Evelyn Chandler in?" he asked of
the servant.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Will you walk in?"</p>

<p>He was ushered into the drawing-room,
where the servant stood waiting for his card.</p>

<p>Kingsley put the idea out of his head that
Miss Chandler was a servant, and handed his
card to the man.</p>

<p>"Will you say to Miss Chandler that I am
a messenger from another, and that I should
appreciate an immediate interview as a
favor?" he said. "Assure her that I will not
detain her five minutes."</p>

<p>The servant bowed and left him. Kingsley
looked about him.</p>

<p>"There is a mystery in this," he said to
himself, "that I must solve. What could
that old drunken tramp have to do with people
like these? Evidently I must keep my
wits about me."</p>

<p>His soliloquy was interrupted by the entrance
of Miss Chandler. Kingsley caught
his breath hard at the vision of beauty she
presented.</p>

<p>She was clad in a gown of dead black,
above which her bare shoulders gleamed like
marble.</p>

<p>She came toward him swiftly, and he had
scarcely recovered himself, when she stood
beside him.</p>

<p>"To what am I indebted for the honor of
this visit, Mr. Kingsley?" she asked, referring
to the card in her hand for the name.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;&mdash; The fact is, I am placed in a most
awkward position, Miss Chandler!" he exclaimed,
flushing furiously. "I was made
the unwilling messenger of a man who has
gotten himself into trouble. He gave me a
message to deliver to Miss Evelyn Chandler,
but you could not by any possible chance be
the lady, though this is the address he gave."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are not mistaken after all.
There are a number of unfortunate people in
whom I am interested. If you would kindly
give me the name of the man I might be able
to tell you whether the person meant was myself!"</p>

<p>"His name is Ben Mauprat, a thoroughly
worthless fellow, but one in whom I have been
interested myself. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think the message is intended for me,
sir!" interrupted Evelyn, with perfect composure.
"You say that Mauprat has gotten
himself into trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a trouble that is more serious than he
thinks, perhaps. He is charged with attempted
murder!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>For all the coolness of her utterance a frightful
pallor overspread the face of the beautiful
girl, that seemed to threaten unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Kingsley took a step toward her as though
to offer assistance, but she recovered herself
and smiled.</p>

<p>"Those things are so dreadful for a lady
to contemplate," he said, deprecatingly. "I
am sorry to have shocked you, Miss Chandler."</p>

<p>"I beg that you will give it no consideration
whatever. Do you know who it was that
he attempted to kill?"</p>

<p>"His wife, I think."</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Those men always do try
to injure the ones who are most necessary to
them. And what message was it that he sent
me?"</p>

<p>"He requested me to say that Liz and
Leonie Cuyler were at his house alone, and
that he was afraid that something would happen
to them."</p>

<p>Again the lovely face grew ghastly, but that
never-failing control was exerted successfully,
and Miss Chandler laughed outright.</p>

<p>"I suppose he wants me to go there to see
that nothing shall befall them, and that, too,
after he has tried to take the life of poor Liz.
Is that not like one of those men? It was so
kind of you, Mr. Kingsley, to take all this
trouble. I am very much obliged to you. It
must really be dreadful for those two poor
women to be in that house alone under the
fearful circumstances."</p>

<p>"It is nothing for me, I assure you. On
the contrary, I shall be but too happy if you
will make any further use of me that you desire.
I see that you are dressed for a reception.
If it would be of any service to you, it
would give me pleasure to go there in your
place and remain during the night if they
should require my presence."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you, but I
think I shall go myself for a moment and
perhaps bring them home. There is really
nothing further that you can do, but be assured
that what you have done is most thoroughly
appreciated. Good-night."</p>

<p>He was so evidently dismissed, that there
was not the slightest excuse for his remaining
longer, and reluctantly he was compelled
to take his leave.</p>

<p>Something in her manner, as she left him,
seemed to attract him, for the door had
scarcely closed upon him, than he paused
with a curious expression upon his face.</p>

<p>"How cleverly she avoided giving me that
address!" he muttered. "Why should she
have turned so pale over the fact that Ben
Mauprat was in trouble? and how is it that a
young lady in her sphere would allow a man
of Ben's stamp to call upon her so freely? As
sure as fate there is something wrong! I
should like nothing better than to get that
young woman in my power, for I have not
seen so pretty, so magnificent a creature in
many days.</p>

<p>"At least, it can do no harm to watch, and,
my pretty Evelyn, you do not leave that
house this evening without my knowing
every foot of ground you touch."</p>

<p>With which commendable resolution, Luis
Kingsley stationed himself upon the opposite
side of the street in the shadow, and took up
his vigils.</p>

<p>As Miss Chandler left the drawing-room she
encountered her adoptive father.</p>

<p>"Are you really ready for once on time?"
he asked. "I am glad of that, as I have a
special reason for wishing to be early."</p>

<p>"You surely would not think of going yet?
Why, there will be no one there at all."</p>

<p>"That is precisely the reason that I wish to
go at once. Now, you know perfectly well
that there is nothing that puts me so thoroughly
out of humor as contradiction, so for
Heaven's sake! leave it off for once and
come immediately! You will find that they
are expecting us early, and besides that, some
one always has to be the first!"</p>

<p>Seeing that Leonard Chandler was in no
mood to stand opposition, Miss Chandler uttered
a sigh and ran lightly up the stairs.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" she asked of herself,
when she was securely in her own room.
"Ben surely meant by his message that I was
not to leave those two alone there; but even
should I go, what could I do against them
both?</p>

<p>"Plainly there is but one course, and that
is to go to the reception, slip out when I return,
and go to that house.</p>

<p>"I don't know what Ben meant, but he
certainly did not send me that message for
fun. I cannot see what he expected me to
do! That is what puzzles me! What in
Heaven's name has ever made him such a
fool? He has risked everything, and perhaps
lost me the stakes for which I have ventured
so much. Curse him! I knew he would do
this sooner or later, but there was no chance
to act without him.</p>

<p>"And now, to please that old fool down-stairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
I have got to go to that reception and
smile and chatter while my thoughts are
occupied with the hideous danger that threatens
me.</p>

<p>"If I could but see Ben for five minutes
and know how things stand! But that is not
even to be thought of! I am afraid of&mdash;&mdash;
Heavens! I dare not think what!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>It was not a pleasant contemplation, that
of facing the dreary, desolate house where
her experiences of that evening had been so
frightful, and it was with a shiver of horror
that Leonie turned from the door which she
had closed upon herself.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment irresolutely, her
womanly cowardice fighting with her strong
desire to gain possession of the papers that
she believed the house to contain, feeling that
if she left it until the morrow that the opportunity
might be forever lost; yet it was a
hard fight.</p>

<p>She was but a girl, weak of courage when
she had time in which to think of fear, and
the occurrences of the evening were not calculated
to eradicate nervousness, yet with a
determination that was singularly strong,
she put fear from her and walked up the
stairs.</p>

<p>All about her was in utter darkness, save
for a ray of light that seemed to creep disconsolately
through the window by which
she had made her escape.</p>

<p>She looked at it with a shudder, remembering
the terrible tragedy that had followed her
exit through it, but not daring to give herself
time for reflection, she began a search for
matches.</p>

<p>She knew where the candle had stood at
the time the pistol put it out, and groping her
way through the gloom she succeeded in finding
it.</p>

<p>There were a few matches upon the waiter
of the holder. The pale gleam cast a fitful
glow over the room that was uncanny. By
it the objects appeared ghostly, and she drew
back with a low cry of fright as her foot
struck the straw of which Dick's bed had been
composed.</p>

<p>She smiled at her own timidity when she
saw what it really was, but her courage was
of that watery character that threatened to
desert her at each moment.</p>

<p>She did not dare to even trust herself to the
inactivity of waiting for the break of day,
but set about looking for the papers of which
Liz had spoken, and which she knew must
exist somewhere. But where was she to
begin to look? She glanced about her helplessly.</p>

<p>"I feel quite sure they are not in the secretary
down-stairs!" she muttered. "There was
not a drawer in it locked, and surely Ben
would not leave things like that about carelessly.
However, there was that letter that I
read, and which I still have. No, they were
not there, or I should have discovered at least
some trace of them. Let me see!"</p>

<p>Carefully she gazed about her, then realizing
that she could hope for nothing without
making a beginning, she began a thorough investigation
of the premises, hampered by the
scarcity of the light.</p>

<p>Behind boxes, in closets, between the pictures
and back of an old chromo that adorned
the wall, under everything that promised a
place of concealment, she looked, but all to no
purpose.</p>

<p>She was about to give it up in despair,
when, as a last resort, she tore the clothing
from the bed upon which Dick had died.</p>

<p>Between the mattress and the cords that
were drawn across the bed in lieu of either
springs or slats, she saw an old tin box!</p>

<p>With a cry of joy, she seized it.</p>

<p>The box was locked, but after a delay that
was most exasperating in her excited state,
Leonie succeeded in breaking the lock with a
hammer.</p>

<p>As the lid opened, she grasped the papers
within, and seating herself at a table, began
looking over them eagerly.</p>

<p>There were extracts from old, yellow newspapers,
photographs that seemed to be the
relics of ages, and letters by the score.</p>

<p>From the contents of the box, one would
have thought the man possessed of a mania
for preserving such things, a thought in which
Leonie would have concurred before she had
completed her self-imposed task.</p>

<p>There were letters from confederates, letters
from friends, letters from his mother, a few
from Liz, and underneath, as though those
were the things that he wanted to preserve
most, she found another box of paper.</p>

<p>She opened it eagerly.</p>

<p>Passing over the smaller papers, she opened
a letter, addressed in the stylish penmanship
which she knew belonged to Miss
Chandler.</p>

<p>Breathlessly she read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just read your letter delivered
by special messenger. The surprise to me has
been so painful that I scarcely know what I
ought to say; but if you will meet me to-night
at the address that I shall append, I
will have thought the matter over. I understand
but too clearly your reason for coming
forward to claim the child whom you deserted
in her infancy, because you know that
now I am the adopted daughter of a wealthy
man who knows nothing of the disgrace that
the penitentiary attached to my parents, and
you think that I shall be only too willing to
purchase your silence at any cost. Perhaps
you are right. We shall see. At all events,
meet me as I have indicated, and if you have
any regard for your own child whatever, be
careful that this letter does not fall into the
hands of any one.</p>

<p class="sig0">
"Yours regretfully,<br />
</p><p class="sig">
"E. C."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>With a thrill of satisfaction Leonie laid the
letter aside, apart from the others that had
been rejected, and took up another.</p>

<p>A single paragraph from it read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You have made me a thief. Were you
not a fiend your conscience would burn you
to death for so foul a thing, but instead you
are going to force me into the cell of a convict,
the same, perhaps, that held both you
and my mother. I am half inclined to believe
that Leonard Chandler already suspects me.
Should he find his suspicions to be true, there
is nothing upon this earth that could save me.
Your revenue would cease. I know that it
would be useless to plead with your sympathy
for me, but for your own sake let your demands
at least be within reason."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your suggestion about Lynde Pyne is a
stroke of genius. With several millions at
his command he will be worthy of the hand
of your illustrious daughter. Keep hold of
the will and trust the rest to me."</p></blockquote>

<p>Scarcely able to control her excitement,
Leonie read the letters through.</p>

<p>"Surely that will be enough!" she exclaimed,
her expression almost fierce. "I will
take copies of these, I will show them to her,
assuring her that the originals are in my possession,
then surely she will not still refuse to
abandon her plan of marrying Lynde Pyne.
I can then place the will where the rightful
heir can be restored and&mdash;go away."</p>

<p>The last words were scarcely more than a
sob, but she resolutely closed her throat upon
it, and turned to her work.</p>

<p>She began to look over them promiscuously.</p>

<p>First came several that amounted to nothing
as far as she was concerned, then followed
some smaller ones. The yellow one that
she had in her hand was read twice.</p>

<p>It was the marriage certificate between
Elizabeth Johnson and Benjamin Mauprat,
dated thirty-two years before.</p>

<p>There was another one of the marriage of
Eleanor Cuyler and Benjamin Mauprat dated
between seven and eight years later, but
across the face of it was written in Ben's own
ungainly scrawl the words in red ink:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An experiment in bigamy. For the edification
of my daughter Evelyn. To be presented
after my death, or immediately before."</p></blockquote>

<p>There was a copy of the certificate of the
birth of Evelyn Mauprat, and also another
copy that was perhaps of more interest than
all to Leonie.</p>

<p>It was the one of her own birth&mdash;"Leonie
Pyne, daughter of Roger and Eleanor Pyne!"</p>

<p>How her heart beat as she read the words,
knowing that she was a legitimate child!</p>

<p>After a long look she put it aside, and turned
her attention entirely to looking for the
will.</p>

<p>She found it at last at the bottom of the
box, wrapped in a piece of tissue paper, and
opening it began to read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Know ye all men by these presents,
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p></blockquote>

<p>Then unable, through feminine curiosity,
to wait further, she looked at the signature.
It was clear enough, and duly witnessed:
"Roger Pyne."</p>

<p>She could scarcely control her excitement
as she read it.</p>

<p>Roger Pyne!</p>

<p>And Roger Pyne was her father!</p>

<p>She sat for some time with the will in her
hand, unable to see the letters because of her
trembling; then by a tremendous effort she
controlled herself, and read it through to the
end.</p>

<p>It stated clearly and concisely that all
other wills made by him were revoked, and
that he had discovered the reports brought to
him by his nephew, Luis Kingsley, about
Lynde Pyne to be utterly and entirely false,
and that in consideration of the evil character
which it showed the said Luis Kingsley
to possess, he desired that it should be known
that he made Lynde Pyne heir to all his estates,
real and personal, cutting Luis Kingsley
off with the proverbial dollar.</p>

<p>Then after it had been read and re-read, the
will dropped into the girl's lap, and her eyes
gazed dreamily from the window.</p>

<p>It was her father who had made that will,
her father who had died believing that the
woman he had made his wife was a bigamist.</p>

<p>Her father who had died in ignorance even
of her birth.</p>

<p>She knew enough of law to know that all
she would be required to do would be to produce
that marriage certificate that was in her
possession, together with the record of her
birth, to break that will, having all those millions
come to her; but the thought brought
her no pleasure.</p>

<p>Even if she had desired to take from Lynde
Pyne what his uncle had given him, she
would be forced to make public her mother's
disgrace in order to do that, and not all the
money in the universe could have tempted
her to even consider it.</p>

<p>Her duty was clear enough.</p>

<p>She must face Evelyn Chandler with the
proofs in her possession; she must know beyond
a doubt that the engagement between
her and Lynde Pyne was broken, she must
restore the will to the one most interested
and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Her work would be accomplished, and for
the sake of her mother's memory she must
go away where the secret could be preserved.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant prospect; and now
that she felt her mission was about at an
end, the desolation and loneliness of her
position struck her with greater force than it
ever had since that morning when she knew
that her single friend had left her forever.</p>

<p>There, in her hands, were all the proofs
that she needed; and as the thought came
that there was no longer a necessity for
bravery, a long, deep sob seemed to come
straight from her heart. She bowed her head
and sobbed.</p>

<p>But in the midst of her yielding to grief,
a sudden sound attracted her, there in that
silent house, where it seemed that even the
noise of a mouse would sound deafening.</p>

<p>She straightened herself suddenly, and
clasping her hands above her heart, listened.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake about it!</p>

<p>It was a footstep, clear and distinct, coming
stealthily up the uncarpeted stairs.</p>

<p>For a moment her heart seemed to stand
still; then, springing up, she dashed to the
door.</p>

<p>Quivering with fright, she undertook to
fasten it and bar it against entrance; but before
she could succeed, a veiled figure, spectral
under the light of the pale candle, stood
before her, preventing the action.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>For some moments it seemed to Leonie as
though the figure that stood before her could
be nothing human.</p>

<p>The very blood seemed to freeze in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
veins. A pallor that had the appearance of
death crept over her face, and a trembling
seized her that seemed to shake her in every
limb.</p>

<p>But it was only for a moment.</p>

<p>The veiled woman stepped forward and uncovered
her face.</p>

<p>"You!" gasped Leonie. "How came you
here at this hour, and what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I came by way of the street-door, and I
want to see Liz!" answered Evelyn Chandler,
coolly. "Where is she?"</p>

<p>"She was taken to the hospital more than
an hour ago."</p>

<p>"And you were here alone?"</p>

<p>"I was until you came!"</p>

<p>With nervous irritation Miss Chandler threw
her eye over the apartment.</p>

<p>It rested upon the chair whereon Leonie
had left the box with the papers scattered
about, some having fallen upon the floor,
others lay on the side of the bed where Dick
had died.</p>

<p>With a low cry, Miss Chandler sprung toward
them.</p>

<p>"And in the absence of the members of the
family, you have been plundering the papers!"
she exclaimed, her alarm causing a hoarseness
that made her voice sound uncanny.</p>

<p>Before she could reach the chair, Leonie had
recovered her powers of action and thought.
She flung herself between Miss Chandler and
the chair, barring her progress.</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried excitedly, "if you choose
to put it so, I have been plundering in the absence
of the family! Do you know what I
have discovered? That you are even a viler
woman than I gave you credit for being.
That you have lied to me, and that you have
rendered further concealment on my part
a sacrifice that I decline to make.</p>

<p>"You knew that the words you said to me
the night that I discovered you to be a thief,
robbing the man who had been a father to
you, were utterly false from beginning to end,
and yet you tried to break my heart without
a revulsion of conscience.</p>

<p>"Now listen to me, Evelyn Chandler, for it
is I who dictate terms this time, and you who
must abide by them or take the consequences.
I have every proof in my possession that
makes me mistress of the situation. I want
the engagement between you and Lynde
Pyne broken without delay. I want him restored
to his rights as the heir of Roger Pyne,
and I want you to make good the last cent of
the money that you took from Leonard
Chandler to buy the silence of your own
father!"</p>

<p>A smile that was cruel in its irony played
over the face of Miss Chandler as she calmly
listened to the girl's words.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" she asked coldly, "or do
you think I am an idiot? It seems that you
have thrust yourself into the secrets that were
never intended for you to know, but since
you have done so, it is useless for me to deny
that Lynde Pyne is the rightful heir and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, he is not! That is only part of your
scheme to deceive me, but I tell you that I
know the story in its entirety. I, Leonie
Pyne, am the rightful heir to that fortune
which I have no intention of ever claiming.
I have my mother's marriage certificate."</p>

<p>"But she was a wife already, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are either deceived yourself, or else
purposely endeavoring to mislead me. Lena
Cuyler's marriage to Ben Mauprat was not
legal, as he had a living wife from whom he
was not divorced at the time of his mock
marriage to my mother. That marriage annulled,
perfectly legalizes her subsequent
union with Roger Pyne and establishes my
birth as legitimate. Therefore I am the rightful
heir. Your birth, you see, is the one upon
which the unfortunate cloud rests that makes
you even possess no right to the name your
convict father wears. Now the question is,
are you ready to resign Lynde Pyne without
publicity being given to these matters, or must
Leonard Chandler and the world come in possession
of a knowledge that I desire to conceal
for my mother's sake? I wish to impress
upon you before you answer, that there
is no romantic feeling of wishing to spare a
sister in my offer to repress the truth or a
portion of it; it is only my dead mother.
Now, what have you to say?"</p>

<p>For some moments a cold, dull gray had
overspread Miss Chandler's face. A wild
horror had come into her eyes, but gradually
she had controlled it.</p>

<p>To be the daughter of a convict was bad
enough surely, but to be his nameless child
was a disgrace of which she had really never
dreamed.</p>

<p>Still, revulsion at the contemplation of disgrace
had never distressed her much, and
she recovered from the feeling quickly.</p>

<p>She determined not to lose the position of
wealth and luxurious ease that she then held
without a desperate struggle, and she was
perfectly aware that to lose Lynde Pyne
meant more to her than one would readily
suppose.</p>

<p>With all her heart she longed to strangle
Leonie, but controlling her venom, she said,
almost humbly:</p>

<p>"I don't think you can realize how you
have surprised me. I cannot think yet that
what you have said can be true. Prove it to
me and I will do what you say. Let me go
over those papers with you. Let me see the
truth for myself."</p>

<p>Leonie laughed.</p>

<p>There in the stillness of the night it rung
out with a little metallic sound that was chilling.
She shivered as it ceased.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I could not trust you so far!"
she exclaimed, coldly. "A woman who
would dare so much as you have already
done will bear watching. You will excuse
me and take my word for it. I know!"</p>

<p>"Why should I do that? Why should I
take your word any more than you should
mine?"</p>

<p>"Because I have never deceived you in
anything. Because I have been perfectly
frank and open always. It is utterly useless,
Evelyn. You can obtain absolutely nothing
from me in that way. I have been deceived
too often to allow you to do it again. These
papers are in my possession now, and there is
no power that could tempt me to part with
them. I will not ask you to make your decision
to-night, but I shall take the liberty of
calling upon you at your own house to-morrow
when you can give me your answer.
And now I shall be grateful if you will let me
alone."</p>

<p>Miss Chandler drew herself up coldly, her
arms folded upon her breast.</p>

<p>"You have had your opportunity to speak
uninterruptedly, now do me the favor to listen
to me," she said, slowly. "I may tell you
that I do not in the least doubt the truth
of what you have said, but I shall go further.
The very fact of not doubting makes me
all the more determined that nothing shall
prevent me from securing those papers, not
even murder! Do you hear me? You know
that I did not pause at theft, and I tell you
that I shall take the risk for what it promises.
There is not a human soul that knows I came
here to-night. What proof, therefore, would
there be against me? If you will give up
those papers willingly, I will divide with you
the fortune that I shall receive through being
the wife of Lynde Pyne. If you refuse I will
have them, cost what they may!"</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt in Leonie's
mind that Miss Chandler meant what she
said.</p>

<p>She threw a quick glance about her to see
where the pistol she had dropped was, and
also to locate the knife which she knew Liz
had.</p>

<p>She saw the revolver immediately. It lay
directly behind Miss Chandler upon the
floor.</p>

<p>In order to get it she would be forced to
leave the papers she was guarding unprotected,
and possibly not even then could she
reach it.</p>

<p>The knife she saw, with a shiver of terror,
was upon a table not a foot from Miss Chandler's
hand, and, as though attracted by the
direction of Leonie's eye Miss Chandler
turned hers in that direction.</p>

<p>She smiled, seeming to comprehend the
thought that had flashed through Leonie's
brain, put out her hand calmly and grasped it
by the handle.</p>

<p>Then she looked at her sister with cold
determination.</p>

<p>Seeing that immediate action was imperative,
Leonie seized the papers that she had
put aside and thrust them into the bosom of
the shirt she wore.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in imitating the dress of the
poorer classes, she had put on a shirt without
a linen bosom, but one that opened down the
front.</p>

<p>She buttoned it quickly, then faced her
companion resolutely.</p>

<p>"If this is to be a fight for possession," she
said, coolly, "it might be fair for me to point
out to you my superior advantages. It is
true that you have that knife in your hand,
but you have nothing like the strength that I
have, and my dress will be of the greatest
possible benefit to me. I warn you that it
will be only with my life that I will resign
the papers that are more to me than all the
world. Do you still intend to contend for
their possession?"</p>

<p>"Your question is not worthy of an answer.
You know that in your bosom you
hold more than life to me&mdash;you hold happiness
and honor. For the last time I ask you
to give them up! I do not intend to purchase
them, but I mean to take them by
force if you still refuse. What is your answer?
Make it for the last time, and
quickly!"</p>

<p>The two women, both desperate, faced
each other with a resolve that meant life or
death.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest evidence of
weakness or fear in either, but a cold determination
that was horrible.</p>

<p>There was the undoubted resemblance of
sisterhood between them as they stood apparently
revolving their plans of action.</p>

<p>Leonie knew full well that there was not
the slightest chance for her.</p>

<p>That the moment she made an effort to pass
that motionless, rigid form that blocked her
passage to the doorway, the long, sharp knife
that Liz had bought to protect her child would
be plunged to the hilt in her body.</p>

<p>She had no wish to die that way, and still
less to place the papers that she held in Miss
Chandler's hands.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant contemplation. She
listened for an instant.</p>

<p>There was not a sound in the street.</p>

<p>She knew that she could not hope for assistance
from that quarter.</p>

<p>The rope by which she had made her escape
before was out the window, and to trust to it
without having it tied about her body was a
most forlorn hope.</p>

<p>There was but one possible way, and that
she seized upon with a suddenness that threw
Miss Chandler entirely off her guard.</p>

<p>She turned and blew out the candle.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler knew nothing of the situation
of the articles of furniture in the room,
and the darkness was intense.</p>

<p>Before her sister's eyes had time to become
accustomed to the absence of light, Leonie
circled about her and reached the door.</p>

<p>She knew that if she could but succeed in
making the street, that her safety would be
assured, and having so much the start of her
pursuer, she did not doubt her ability to do
so.</p>

<p>With a savage cry Miss Chandler started
after, but Leonie's advantage was too great
to be denied.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler was about to give up in
despair, when a sharp, agonized cry from the
dark hall almost froze her blood.</p>

<p>She hurried down the steps and groped
about in the gloom until her hand came in
contact with something, she scarcely knew
what.</p>

<p>She shrunk back with a start of terror.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>With all her frail strength, Leonie was
struggling in the grasp of a person who held
her with the strength of a giant.</p>

<p>The excitement of the entire day had been
too much for her and unconsciousness was
threatened, but by a mighty effort she overcame
it, knowing too well that upon the perfect
retention of her faculties, everything
depended.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" she cried struggling to free
herself. "Let me go!"</p>

<p>"Tell me first where you were going in
such hot haste at this hour in the morning
and why?" demanded the stranger. "I
claim that you are a thief."</p>

<p>"Then have me arrested," exclaimed Leonie,
"but do not detain me here!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"You seem too willing. I must understand
the cause of all this before I do anything.
Now act like a sensible boy and tell
me where you were going and why?"</p>

<p>Leonie only continued to struggle.</p>

<p>Holding her with one hand in a grasp like
iron the stranger took a match-safe from his
pocket, and holding it between his teeth
while he selected one, he struck it and
lighted the gas in the hall.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler uttered a low cry and fell
back. She had recognized Luis Kingsley.</p>

<p>His eyes met hers in a look of affected surprise.</p>

<p>"You, Miss Chandler!" he exclaimed.
"This is indeed an unexpected encounter.
Was this little vagrant trying to rob you?"</p>

<p>Miss Chandler was utterly at a loss what
reply to make. She had almost as soon have
had that will in the possession of Leonie Cuyler
as of Luis Kingsley, and a chill of horror
seemed to seal her lips.</p>

<p>A silence that was painful settled upon
them.</p>

<p>Leonie could not exactly comprehend the
situation, but she could see that Miss Chandler
was not anxious to have the man know
the secret that she was endeavoring to conceal,
and Evelyn was striving to determine
how much he had heard of the conversation
that had taken place up-stairs.</p>

<p>Leonie had determined that she would tell
him the truth, as he appeared a gentleman;
and seeming to read something of her determination,
Evelyn Chandler forced herself
to speak.</p>

<p>"How came you here at this hour, Mr.
Kingsley?" she asked coldly.</p>

<p>Leonie started perceptibly. The name told
her all that Evelyn wished her to know.</p>

<p>"I might put the same question to you
with effect, Miss Chandler," he returned.</p>

<p>"I came by the desire of Ben Mauprat, as
you know. A man whose wife I have befriended
more than once. My presence here
is therefore not to be questioned; but yours
seems singularly like unwarranted interference."</p>

<p>"Your words are curious, coming to one
who entered to protect what he believed to be
a woman in distress. May I inquire who this
boy is? And why there seemed to be a quarrel&mdash;if
not a fight&mdash;going on between you?
My dear Miss Chandler, a young lady in society
may have the right to go from one reception
to another between three and four
o'clock in the morning, but they are not so
charitably inclined that they make disinterested
visits at this hour. I confess that my
curiosity is aroused. Where is the wife of
Ben Mauprat? Who is this boy? Why are
you here? And why was he endeavoring to
escape you? I readily acknowledge that I may
not have the right to ask you these questions,
but situated as we are, I not only do ask them,
but I demand that you answer."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I shall take the trouble to discover
for myself."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. I shall answer them.
In the first place, the wife of Ben Mauprat is
ill and has been taken to the hospital. The
boy is Ben Mauprat's son. I was here at the
request of Ben Mauprat to know if there were
not something that I could do for the family
in whom I have long been deeply interested.
He was endeavoring to escape me because I
wished to turn him over to the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children to be
taken care of. Even if Ben should be released
from the position in which he is now
placed, he is not a proper guardian for that
boy, but the boy did not wish to do as I said.
Now, is that satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"And you were demanding obedience to
your will at the point of a knife. Was that
it, Miss Chandler?" asked Kingsley, coolly
ignoring her question.</p>

<p>She glanced down.</p>

<p>In her hand she still held the knife that she
had taken from the table, and which, in her
excitement, she had forgotten.</p>

<p>Her face became crimson. She could find
no answer, and with a short laugh Kingsley
turned to Leonie.</p>

<p>"What have you to say?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" she answered. "I deny your
right to detain me here, and I command you
to release me!"</p>

<p>"Spoken like a true son of Ben Mauprat!"
exclaimed Kingsley, ironically. "It may not
come amiss for me to remind you, Miss
Chandler, nor you, Master Mauprat, that I
have never been taken for a fool, and even if
I had, there is no reason to believe that I am
one. I have never gone prowling round in
the dead of night without an object; therefore,
following my usual example, I did not
come here without one. I know that there is
a mystery afloat. I have scented it, and I
am determined to fathom it. I do not believe
that you two are interested in it alone. I intend
to search this house, after I have first
made an examination of this boy to see what
he has concealed upon his person with which
he wished to escape, and which you were determined
to prevent at the risk of murder."</p>

<p>He looked from Leonie to Evelyn, and from
Evelyn back to Leonie, but neither spoke.</p>

<p>Both were endeavoring to think of some
plan of action, and one seemed to be as uninventive
as the other.</p>

<p>Had there been a desire upon Miss Chandler's
part to act in unison with her sister, they
might readily have thwarted Luis Kingsley,
but there was little more desire in her heart
to have Leonie in possession of the papers
than Kingsley.</p>

<p>One promised as little to her as the other.</p>

<p>She lifted her head, and looked defiantly at
the man.</p>

<p>"You have expressed your determination,"
she said, coldly, "now listen to mine. I propose
that you shall leave this house, and I intend
that you shall do it without accomplishing
the design that you have intended. The
question is, will you do it peaceably or not?"</p>

<p>Kingsley looked at her in absolute amazement.</p>

<p>She saw that it was a desperate case, and
desperate cases required heroic handling, but
he was unprepared for the amount of spirit
that she displayed in a woman.</p>

<p>There was something like admiration in the
glance that he bent upon her.</p>

<p>"Whether I do or not you deserve credit
for your bravery!" he answered, slowly. "I
do admire it! Upon my soul I do! Let me
tell you something, Miss Chandler! Whatever
you may say to the contrary, I am fully convinced
that you did not come here this night
for motives of charity alone, and I am further
convinced that the reason that you gave for
your unpleasantness with this boy was&mdash;pardon
me&mdash;not the truth. But for all that, there
is something about you that appeals to me
strongly. I don't want to be your enemy! I
don't want to do anything that will in any
way injure you, but there are reasons why I
am just as much interested in the contents of
this house as you can be; therefore if you will
take me into your confidence and trust me,
there is no reason why we should not work
together and benefit each other. A woman of
your standing and wealth does not interest
herself in a man like Ben Mauprat for nothing.
Come, now! Is this to be a sort of partnership
between us, or are you determined
that I shall find out all for myself, to your
detriment, perhaps?"</p>

<p>Leonie breathlessly awaited the answer.
She felt that upon it depended her chance of
escape with the papers, and so of saving
Lynde Pyne.</p>

<p>It came at last!</p>

<p>Miss Chandler looked at him without flinching,
and replied:</p>

<p>"There is no reason why I should make any
bargain with you, sir. I command you to
leave the house! In the event of your refusing
to do so, I have in my possession a revolver
which I shall not hesitate to use. I have
not wished to threaten, but you have forced it
upon me. Do not think that I shall fear, for
this is that boy's home, and he has the right
to protect it from entrance of burglars
who break in in the dead of the night. He
will be the single witness in the case, and I
think I shall have nothing to fear from him.
Now once more, will you go?"</p>

<p>"Now less than ever! You have firmly
convinced me that there is something, even
more than I thought, at the bottom of all this,
and I am determined to discover it. Now,
my dainty one!"</p>

<p>With a suddenness that lost Leonie her
footing, he dropped his hold of her, and
sprung toward Miss Chandler, catching her
about the waist and pinioning her arms.
With the ease of an athlete he turned her
around, and wrenching the knife from her
hand, threw it upon the floor.</p>

<p>Leonie had secured it within the twinkling
of an eye, and with it she sprung toward the
door.</p>

<p>But Kingsley had not left the rear unguarded
in any such manner as that. She fell
back with a little gasp of terror.</p>

<p>It was locked!</p>

<p>As soon as she could recover from her disappointment
she turned and looked at Evelyn
and Kingsley.</p>

<p>He had pushed her backward upon the
stairs, and holding her with one hand and
his knee succeeded in finding the revolver of
which she had spoken.</p>

<p>Without the quiver of a muscle he calmly
pocketed it, and released her from her uncomfortable
position.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that you forced me to treat
you so roughly," he said mildly. "There is
nothing more annoying than to be compelled
to use one's strength against a woman. There
is so little of manhood in it, and yet one cannot
always help it. Now, Master Mauprat,
that you have seen there is no possibility of
escape, are you ready to stand and deliver?"</p>

<p>There was something almost genial in his
manner of saying it, and but for her knowledge
that he was an utter scoundrel, Leonie
could almost have liked him.</p>

<p>Yet she did not think much of that at the
moment. Her mind was centered upon how
she was to get away with those papers, a
thing that began to appear to the last degree
hopeless.</p>

<p>Then suddenly an idea struck her.</p>

<p>She realized how impossible it was for her
to cope with him physically, for she would
be less than a feather in his hand, and she
saw that if she was to save Lynde Pyne she
must give up the idea of sparing Evelyn
Chandler.</p>

<p>She saw her way if she could but prevent
Luis Kingsley from seeing the certificate of
her mother's marriage with his uncle.</p>

<p>With a deprecating gesture she turned the
handle of the knife toward him, as the vanquished
do in battle when acknowledging
themselves defeated.</p>

<p>He smiled as he took it, not endeavoring
to conceal his surprise.</p>

<p>"You have not offered to compromise with
me, Mr. Kingsley," she said coolly, "but I
am open to a consideration of that kind if you
see fit to make it. No, further than that, I
will make the offer, if you are prepared to
listen."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p>Before Kingsley had an opportunity to reply,
Miss Chandler had sprung by him and
had caught Leonie's hand in an iron grasp.</p>

<p>"You must be mad!" she whispered hoarsely.
"Think what you are doing! You lose
every possible hope! There is no doubt but
what we can escape if you will only help me.
For God's sake keep your wits about you and
do the thing you contemplate only when you
are overpowered and forced to yield."</p>

<p>But Leonie had no idea of considering any
such advice.</p>

<p>She perfectly realized there was not the
shadow of a hope for them, and she wanted
to preserve that marriage certificate.</p>

<p>She understood that it was but the copy of
a record, and that she could prove her words
without it; but it was the greatest saving of
valuable time to keep what she had.</p>

<p>Besides, she had not looked at the name of
the clergyman nor the witnesses, and they
might be very hard to find.</p>

<p>Kingsley made no move whatever to intercept
Miss Chandler.</p>

<p>He knew his power, and he allowed her,
without interference, to talk to her companion
as much as she chose, though every
word that she uttered could be distinctly
heard by him.</p>

<p>With a slow smile, though she was far from
feeling in any degree mirthful, Leonie turned
in his direction.</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to answer my question?"
she asked calmly.</p>

<p>"I am," he replied. "You shall have ample
time to say anything that you wish. Will
you proceed at once?"</p>

<p>"By doing that you will lose everything,"
gasped Miss Chandler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The smile on Leonie's face only deepened.</p>

<p>"You must remember that there is honor
among thieves, Mr. Luis Kingsley," she began,
"and the promise that you shall make me
before you hear my secret must be kept to
the letter. Do you agree?"</p>

<p>"I agree to abide by whatever promise I
make. You may be sure of that. But the
question is, whether I shall make the promise
or not."</p>

<p>"I think you will. It can make no possible
difference to you who I am, nor how I came
by my information, but I have come into possession
of a secret of yours which I am willing
to sell for my liberty. I will tell you in the first
place that the reason why I do not wish you
to search me is that I am not the boy that you
suppose, but a woman."</p>

<p>"This is growing interesting. Go on!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, several years ago you had an
uncle of great wealth."</p>

<p>"Leonie, for God's sake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Chandler had interrupted, but Leonie
talked on as though unaware of it.</p>

<p>"He was fond of a cousin of yours, but
not of you. The cousin's name was Lynde
Pyne. He had been brought up to look upon
himself as your uncle's heir, a fact of which
you were unable to see the justice. You were
determined that such should not be the case.
You, therefore, went systematically to work
to alienate the affection of your uncle from his
favorite nephew, pouring into his ears a tale
of the treachery of Lynde Pyne that finally
had the desired effect&mdash;that of causing your
uncle to make a new will, leaving to you the
bulk of his fortune."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that for a young woman
whom I never saw before in my life, you are
wonderfully well acquainted with my affairs."</p>

<p>"Poor girls need money as well as other
people, and some of us have learned from men
that the easiest way to obtain it, is often to
discover the private affairs of men of millions
like yourself, and trade upon the knowledge
that we have gained."</p>

<p>"And how do you propose to handle this?"</p>

<p>"That is just what I am going to tell you."</p>

<p>She turned for a moment and looked at her
sister. She was standing with her back leaning
against the door, her face deadly white,
her eyes glaring like those of an animal.</p>

<p>It was a desperate case with her, but there
seemed absolutely nothing that she could do
to avert the terrible danger that threatened
her.</p>

<p>A weakness came over Leonie, the weakness
that is engendered by human sympathy
for a person in distress, but then a consideration
of all that Miss Chandler had done
against her wiped it out, and she turned her
eyes in the direction of Kingsley with a little
shudder of horror.</p>

<p>She resolutely forced herself not to glance
again toward the shrinking woman.</p>

<p>"Go on, please," exclaimed Kingsley, a
trifle nervously.</p>

<p>"You asked me, I think, how I proposed to
handle this," returned Leonie. "Well, I
have not quite reached that point yet. You
know sometimes a trade falls through, and
the larger the transaction the greater the
danger attending it. Now, Mr. Kingsley,
fortunately for your cousin, but most unfortunately
for you, the stories told by you
about Lynde Pyne to your uncle were discovered
by him to be false while there was yet
time remaining to him to make a new will.
That will was made!"</p>

<p>"You are sure?"</p>

<p>"I have read it myself. You are cut out
without a dollar, while the entire fortune is
given to Mr. Pyne without reservation. What
I propose is to deliver that will over to you,
if you will release me from this place without
trying to in any way molest me, or attempting
to search me."</p>

<p>"You have the will?"</p>

<p>"I decline to answer that question, but I
know where it is, and I will put you in possession
of it when I have your assurance that
you will do as I have demanded. So far as
the other papers are concerned, they relate to
the birth of a person, which cannot concern
you, but in which I am interested as I was
in the securing of that will. You understand
me, I think, without further explanation."</p>

<p>She intended him to believe that she
wanted to extract money from Miss Chandler,
and he fell into the trap easily enough.</p>

<p>"I am willing," she continued, "to give up
the papers that concern you if you will allow
me to retain the others that are in my keeping
without interference."</p>

<p>He smiled curiously.</p>

<p>"I accept the terms," he said, slowly. "I
think Miss Chandler's presence here places
her as much in my power as I care to have
her, and I am not at all desirous of securing
her money, therefore I agree to your terms."</p>

<p>Evelyn Chandler started forward, her ashen
face more pallid than ever.</p>

<p>"You will eternally regret it if you do!"
she gasped, hoarsely. "Do you know what
the papers are that she wishes to conceal?
Do you know who she is?"</p>

<p>"The key to this door!" cried Leonie, excitedly.
"Throw it to me and the will is
yours!"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, now!" gasped Miss Chandler.
"I swear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here is the will!" interrupted Leonie.
"The key&mdash;quick! There is a man in front
of the house. If you hesitate I shall break
the glass and pitch it through if you kill me!"</p>

<p>"Hear me!" panted Miss Chandler, catching
Kingsley by the lapel of the coat and
holding him frantically.</p>

<p>It but impeded his progress as he would
have sprung toward Leonie; and seeing that
she would not hesitate a moment to accomplish
the purpose that she had assured him she
would, he took the key from his pocket and
flung it toward her.</p>

<p>Knowing that he would catch her if she
made any attempt to escape with the will, she
threw it down, unlocked the door, and sped
away down the street like the wind.</p>

<p>The man of whom she had spoken as being
across the street was a myth, but it had seemed
to put an idea into her head that strangely
enough had not occurred to her before.</p>

<p>Not even pausing to take breath, she ran
along under the gray of the awakening morning,
her mouth parched and dry, her tongue
seeming to cleave to the roof of her mouth.</p>

<p>About three blocks away she found a policeman.
Excitedly she caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she gasped. "A moment's delay,
and you will be too late! He may have
escaped now! There are millions of money
depending upon it. Quick!"</p>

<p>Something of her excitement seemed to
communicate itself to the tired man. He set
into a run with her, and with an evidence of
surprise, stopped before the residence of Ben
Mauprat, where the door was already open,
and in which he could see the shadowy figures
of a man and woman.</p>

<p>With the officer, Leonie sprung up the
steps.</p>

<p>"Arrest that man!" she gasped, pointing
dramatically toward Luis Kingsley. "He
has a will in his possession that has been suppressed
for years!"</p>

<p>"Arrest that woman, who is masquerading
in the clothes of a man!" exclaimed Kingsley
angrily, seeing that he had fallen into a
trap.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler had sunk back helplessly.
The officer glanced hastily from one to the
other.</p>

<p>"I think I had better take you all in!" he
said. "That seems to be the safe plan. Come,
now, and no foolishness!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>


<p>Placing the three before him, and compelling
them to lock arms, the officer was about
to take up the line of march, when something
in the back pocket of the man's trousers attracted
him, the coat being lifted a trifle over
it.</p>

<p>He thrust his hand forward and pulled the
pistol from it that Kingsley had taken from
Miss Chandler.</p>

<p>It was the single hope that the man had retained
of release, and a low oath fell from his
lips as he realized that it was gone.</p>

<p>"I owe this to you!" he exclaimed to
Leonie. "You shall see how well I know
how to liquidate my debts. Is this the honor
that you claimed should be among thieves? I
kept my word and you betrayed me; you
shall pay for it with interest."</p>

<p>"Stop your threats and go along quietly,
or I'll quiet you," cried the officer, lifting his
club threateningly. "You are a nice party
altogether, you are."</p>

<p>The sergeant's eyes were opened to their
widest as the gentleman of elegant appearance,
and the lady in the costume of a reception,
entered his precinct.</p>

<p>"What are this lady and gentleman arrested
for?" he inquired sternly of the officer.</p>

<p>"Absolutely without reason!" exclaimed
Kingsley, attempting bravado. "We were
out on a little mission of charity in connection
with a family that has had a terrible affliction
befall them to-night, when the officer arrested
us. It is an outrage!"</p>

<p>"What have you to say, officer?"</p>

<p>"Only this, sir: I was on my beat when
this boy came running up to me out of breath
and demanded that I go with him to arrest
these parties. I went to see what was wrong,
and I found these people under suspicious circumstances.
The boy claimed that the man
had a will concealed upon him that had been
hidden for years, and the man claimed that
the boy was a girl in disguise. The house
that they were visiting to perform a charity
was the one belonging to Ben Mauprat, who
was arrested to-night, and whose wife jumped
out the window later with her child in her
arms, so that there was nobody in the house
for them to have gone there to see."</p>

<p>The sergeant looked dubious, then after a
moment of hesitation, he decided to "hold
them for examination!"</p>

<p>It was with perhaps the greatest amount of
relief that she had ever felt in her life that
Leonie saw the two conducted to their respective
cells, though she knew that she must
follow.</p>

<p>As she was leaving the room, she lifted her
eyes pleadingly to those of the sergeant and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There is no chance of his escaping with
that will, is there? It would place in his
possession a large sum of money that rightfully
belongs to another."</p>

<p>"That will, if one exists, will be deposited
with me inside of fifteen minutes!" he answered.</p>

<p>It had been a night that was to be long remembered
by Leonie.</p>

<p>She was thoroughly exhausted in mind and
body, and feeling mentally at rest at last in
her cramped apartment, she stretched herself
out wearily upon the hard bench that was
the only bed offered, and was soon sound
asleep.</p>

<p>There was a vague wonderment as to what
had happened to Liz, and what she was to do
when all the facts that surrounded her had
been made public; but she was too tired for
anything under heaven to disturb her, and
after a moment of wakeful dreaming she was
in the land of Nod!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"You have heard nothing yet from Neil
Lowell?"</p>

<p>The question was addressed by Lynde
Pyne to Andrew Pryor as the two men shook
hands on the morning after the event just
narrated had taken place.</p>

<p>"I was about to put the same question to
you," returned the elder man. "I am losing
hope. I wonder what could have happened to
the boy? I have given his description to
every police station in the city; I have private
detectives at work, I have done everything
that lies in my power, but all to no purpose!
The matter is shrouded in as great a
mystery as it was at the beginning. I am
about coming to the conclusion that he has
been foully dealt with!"</p>

<p>Pyne started.</p>

<p>"How is that possible?" he asked, half unconscious
of having spoken.</p>

<p>"How is it possible!" cried Mr. Pryor with
annoyance. "How are half the horrible
things that you read of daily in the papers
possible? I don't know, but one never can
tell what may happen, nor what has happened.
I have had the most flaming advertisements
in the papers, asking him if he were
safe to at least let me know. Lowell was a
great reader of the papers, and if he had seen
it he would surely have answered in some
way. He has never seen it, and he has not
because&mdash;he is dead!"</p>

<p>Pyne's hand came down upon a glass,
knocking it to the floor with an awful crash.</p>

<p>His face was ghastly.</p>

<p>"Have you any reason for thinking that?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
he demanded so hoarsely that Pryor's attention
was attracted from his concern about
Leonie to his friend.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he answered. "Why, what is
it, Pyne? You were not acquainted with
Lowell, were you? I did not know that you
had ever met him more than once."</p>

<p>"You are quite right! It is only the horror
with which those things naturally affect me.
I can never regard such things, even in imagination,
without feeling faint."</p>

<p>"In your profession I should think you
would have overcome such things entirely!"</p>

<p>"One would think so, but it does not seem
to have been the case with me. I do not believe
that I shall ever recover from it. My
cousin was to go to Miss Chandler's to begin
her visit there to-day, was she not?"</p>

<p>"I think so; but not until this afternoon.
Do you want to see her?"</p>

<p>"If you please. Will you kindly send for
her to come here?"</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor was about to put his hand
upon the bell to ring, when the door was suddenly
thrown open, and Miss Pyne, with Miss
Pryor, entered.</p>

<p>The former held a newspaper in her hand,
and both seemed excited to the last degree.
They paused, however, upon seeing Lynde.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he demanded, as neither of
them even greeted him. "There was something
that you wished to say, and you have
hesitated because I am here. Can you not
tell me, Edith, unless your news is a secret?
The papers do not usually contain secrets that
the world may not share, and from your
manner I should say that it is something that
you have learned from them."</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Lynde," she answered,
laying her hand affectionately upon his
shoulder. "I did learn my news from the
papers, but it is something that will hurt you
most seriously. So much so that I am afraid
to tell you. But of course there can be no
truth in it. You must take consolation in
that, dear."</p>

<p>He had grown ghastly again. He endeavored
to speak, but the horror that was upon
him seemed to paralyze utterance.</p>

<p>He took the paper from her, and in silence
she pointed to the article that had caused her
such consternation.</p>

<p>The headlines were sensational, describing
as they did the arrest of Miss Evelyn Chandler,
the daughter of one of the wealthiest
citizens of the metropolis, in company with
Luis Kingsley, of Wall Street fame, in a disreputable
place.</p>

<p>Edith Pyne had read no further than that;
but calling the attention of Miss Pryor to it,
they had hurried with it to Mr. Pryor's study.</p>

<p>The paper dropped from Lynde's hand and
fluttered to the floor.</p>

<p>He seemed to understand that some dreadful
thing had happened, that there could be
no mistake, and though Leonie's name was
not mentioned in those first lines, he seemed
to know intuitively that they related to her.</p>

<p>He sat down in a chair very suddenly, and
Edith kneeled beside him.</p>

<p>"You must not take those horrible words
as literally true," she exclaimed, gently.
"You know so well how many mistakes these
papers make. Do not look like that, Lynde!
You frighten me!"</p>

<p>"Do not distress yourself about me, dear,"
he said, gently. "There is nothing wrong.
Read the article to me, please. I do not seem
able to see quite distinctly."</p>

<p>Still kneeling there beside him, she read it
to the end. About the arrest in the deserted
house of Ben Mauprat, about the sensational
demand of the boy for the arrest of the man
with the will, of the counter-charge of disguised
sex made by the man, of the march to
the station-house, of the costumes of the
party, of how the "boy" had given his name
as Leonie Cuyler Pyne&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly Miss Pyne's face was lifted,
ghastly as Lynde's own.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" she demanded,
huskily.</p>

<p>"Never mind. Read on!" he commanded,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>Then the papers found were described and
copied, the will acting as a kind of supplement.</p>

<p>There was not a word spoken in that room
for the space of five minutes when the reading
had ceased.</p>

<p>Mr. Pryor was the first to break the stillness
that had grown uncanny.</p>

<p>"Let me be the first to congratulate you,
Lynde," he said, his kind old voice shaken
with emotion. "You have gained your
fortune at last, and if it has cost you a wife,
the loss is the greater gain of the two."</p>

<p>"It is not true!" cried Lynde, hoarsely.
"There is not a word of it that can be true.
There was never any such will made. My
uncle died, believing me guilty of the acts of
which my cousin accused me, and Roger
Pyne was never married in his life. Do you
think that he could have had a wife and I not
know it! Why, it would have been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, remembering the
comments that had been made upon the resemblance
between Edith and Leonie upon
that night that they had sat side by side at
the table.</p>

<p>It seemed to offer a certain proof of the
truth of the story that startled him.</p>

<p>He arose hastily and picked up his hat.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Edith asked,
timidly, something in his expression frightening
her.</p>

<p>"To the station-house where these people
are said to be. I must know the truth."</p>

<p>Then, after the hesitation of a moment, he
turned to Mr. Pryor, remarking:</p>

<p>"Do not distress yourself further about
Neil Lowell until I see you again. If the
article contained in that paper is true I can
take you to him within the hour."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you now. There is a mysterious
something that makes me horribly
afraid that I shall find it all too true, but
until my return I can say nothing!"</p>

<p>"Why cannot I accompany you? You
surely know that you can trust me!"</p>

<p>"With all my heart! Come, if you will."</p>

<p>Lynde bent his head and kissed his cousin.
With an impulse that she could scarcely understand
she reached up and placed her arms
about his neck.</p>

<p>"Something tells me that you will not find
it false, dear," she said, gently, "and, notwithstanding
the sorrow that it will bring
upon that unfortunate woman, I cannot regret
it. But if it should prove true, I feel
convinced that that woman will try to hold
you to the promise that you have made her
by pleading the cause of her love. Promise
me that you will not listen to her, Lynde!"</p>

<p>He kissed her again and sighed.</p>

<p>"You must not ask me to promise until I
know what I am doing, for I have never
broken one in my life, dear."</p>

<p>He loosened her arms from his neck, thinking,
with something like a choking sensation,
of the one that he had already given and
wondering if anything would happen to release
him from it before it was eternally too
late.</p>

<p>Resolutely he put the thought from his
mind and turned again to Andrew Pryor.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" he asked, the anxiety in
his voice increasing.</p>

<p>"Yes. You may be sure that it is all true,
Lynde, and that you are the heir to your
uncle's fortune at last."</p>

<p>"You seem to have forgotten, all of you,
that if this story is true, that will can make
small difference to me, as my uncle left a
daughter of whose existence he died in ignorance.
The money will be even less mine than
it was before. Do not think that I grudge it
to the unfortunate girl, for that is the only
part of the story that offers me any pleasure
at all."</p>

<p>The consternation of the group was even
greater than before, but not waiting for comment,
Lynde placed his hand upon Mr. Pryor's
arm and hurried him from the room.</p>

<p>"There is one hope!" exclaimed Edith to
Miss Pryor when the men had gone. "If
Miss Chandler knows that there is no chance
for Lynde to get the money she will not hold
him to that miserable engagement, perhaps,
for I feel convinced from his manner that if
she should he would still marry her!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>By courtesy of the captain, Miss Evelyn
Chandler was allowed to receive a guest who
had called upon her, in his private office.</p>

<p>She had expected to see Lynde Pyne, and
had prepared her manner of receiving him;
but as the door opened she staggered back before
the pale, haggard face that confronted
her.</p>

<p>"You!" she exclaimed, as the door was
closed, and she found herself alone with the
man who had been a father to her, and whom
she had so grossly deceived. "I&mdash;I&mdash;did not
expect you quite so soon! Did you receive
my note?"</p>

<p>All the usual bluster seemed gone from the
man's manner.</p>

<p>One would scarcely have recognized Leonard
Chandler in the subdued, pale man that
stood before Evelyn; but there was something
about him that frightened her more than that
had ever done. She trembled as his eyes held
hers, and catching by the back of a chair, let
herself down in it as though to release her
hold meant a fall.</p>

<p>"I have received nothing!" he answered
gravely. "What information I have had
came to me from the newspapers, confirmed
by the fact that you were not in your room
this morning, nor had you been all night! I
have come for a denial of the shameful story
that has been published from you, and for irrefutable
proof of that denial!"</p>

<p>He spoke calmly, but the most disinterested
could have seen how he was suffering.</p>

<p>His pride had been cut to the quick; besides
which, he loved the girl who had been
one of his household since her childhood, and
who had taken the place of the daughter that
he had so much craved, but that had not
been given him.</p>

<p>Evelyn fancied she saw some hope in his
sorrow.</p>

<p>She clasped her hands pleadingly before
her.</p>

<p>"I know that appearances are terribly
against me!" she cried desperately. "I have
no proof that I can bring forward in my own
defense, but I am innocent. It is a hideous
plot that they have concocted to deprive me
of my honor, and to rob you of your money.
If you will only help me, I am quite sure that
we can find a way to prove how false it is."</p>

<p>He heaved a sigh that contained a note of
relief.</p>

<p>"If I am to help you, and of course you
know that if you are innocent I will do that
to the expenditure of the last dollar that I
possess in the world, you must answer my
questions clearly and truthfully," he said,
passing his hand across his brow wearily. "I
shall not try to conceal from you how this
has hurt me. It has stung my pride and
pierced my heart. My wife is in bed under
the shock of it all, for she has loved you as
well as though you had been in reality her
child. We must begin at the beginning and
take matters as they came. Why were you
in that house last night?"</p>

<p>"The woman, Liz, to whom I had been
kind, sent for me!"</p>

<p>"And you went in the night without ordering
the carriage? You went to that part of
the city alone? Listen to me, Evelyn! You
know how anxious I am to do for you anything
that lies in my power, but I will not assist
you in a lie, and that is one! You must
tell the truth, if you expect anything from
me in return."</p>

<p>"Then listen to me, and I <i>will</i> tell you the
truth whatever the cost to myself. You
know that I am not your child. I knew that
fact. One day a man came to me&mdash;such a
terrible man that no words could ever describe
him to you. He told me that he was
my father. He told me the most odious
secret of my birth, and in my terror I allowed
him to see that I knew little of my own
antecedents, and that he could work upon my
fears. It continued until I wrote him that
first letter that you saw copied in the papers.</p>

<p>"Then I discovered that what he had said
was a lie from the beginning. He had known
my mother and knew the story of my adoption,
determining to work upon that to extract
money from me. I found it out in time,
and forced him to admit that it was true.
Then he forged the other letters that you saw
printed. Last night I received a letter from
his wife telling me that he had been arrested,
and that she had found those letters. She
offered to place them in my hands if I would
go there for them, assuring me that she would
not deliver them to a messenger for fear of
their never reaching me. I went; you know
the rest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>For a long time Leonard Chandler was silent.</p>

<p>The story had been dramatically told, and
it seemed to him that it might be the truth.</p>

<p>With all the heart he had he hoped it was,
and there was something like eagerness in his
voice as he put his next question.</p>

<p>"Where is the letter that the woman sent
you?"</p>

<p>She colored.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I destroyed it," she stammered.</p>

<p>"Destroyed it! Why? Wait a minute!
The papers stated that the woman jumped
from the window a few hours after the arrest
of her husband, crazed by the death of her
child. In a state of mind like that, how was
it possible that the poor woman could have
thought of writing to you? Besides, knowing
that Mauprat was arrested for attempted
murder, why should she have written you so
late at night? And why would not the morning
have done for your visit?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I did not&mdash;know how long he would be
confined, nor did she."</p>

<p>"Evelyn, are you telling me the truth? It
does not seem so. It will be useless for you
to lie to me, for that woman's insanity was
but a temporary aberration of the mind; and
while she can never recover from the injuries
of her fall, she is perfectly able to answer any
questions that may be put to her."</p>

<p>The girl was silent from inability to speak.</p>

<p>She had not read the part of the paper that
told of Liz Mauprat's condition, and her single
chance lay in the fact of her death!</p>

<p>But she was not dead.</p>

<p>The fates seemed conspiring against her.</p>

<p>She lifted her head, but not an idea could
penetrate the mental darkness about her.</p>

<p>For the first time her composure failed
her.</p>

<p>Her tongue seemed cleaving to her mouth,
her lips were dry and parched.</p>

<p>She had hoped, but the hope was dying.</p>

<p>"Evelyn," Mr. Chandler said slowly,
"granting what you have said to be the
truth, how do you reconcile the fact of your
mother's name having been Mauprat to the
story you have told? We adopted you, my
wife and I, and we never saw your mother
again, but the papers of adoption gave her
name as Eleanor Mauprat, and the certificate
of your birth, and of her false marriage to
your father, tells the rest. Can you explain
those truths away? I don't want to be hard
with you. I want to give you every chance
that lies in my power, but I will not protect a
woman who would rob her best friend, who
would condemn her sister, as the monster
they make you appear has done; who would
stop at no wrong however great, to save herself
from a humiliation that at worst could
have been but the sting of an hour. If this
thing is true, and that man were really your
father, was the fault yours? Were you not
so much the more to be sympathized with,
that your birth rested under such a cloud? If
you had but trusted to me, do you not know
that I would have protected you?"</p>

<p>Very slowly she arose from her chair and
stood before him.</p>

<p>Her color had returned until a spot of crimson
burned in either cheek.</p>

<p>The timidity of her manner had vanished.</p>

<p>She was the same girl that had defied
Leonie Cuyler in the library at the time she
was discovered to be a thief!</p>

<p>"Do I not know that you would have protected
me?" she asked coldly. "No, I do not!
You came here and have offered to assist me,
because you did not wish your name brought
in the scandal that you felt was about to be
connected with me, and now you wish to pose
as a saintly and martyred man who rescued
the daughter of a convict but to have the serpent
sting you. You think that I should fall
down and bless you for what you have done
for me? Let me tell you how I appreciate it.
From my earliest remembrance my only feeling
for you was one of fear. I would have
applied to any stranger for assistance sooner
than to you. You let me know in a thousand
ways that upon my conduct alone depended
my chance of remaining in the position in
which you had placed me. You had shown
me the luxury of money, you had me educated
to the belief that life was not worth the living
without it. You gave me no means by
which I could earn my own support and I
knew that expulsion from your door meant
starvation or service in some one's kitchen.
It was theft to close the mouth of my father
or death to me! I chose the easier. You ask
if what I have told you is the truth? Well,
then, no! I am the daughter of an ex-convict.
Worse than that, my mother died in
the Tombs, convicted of theft! I did steal
your money, and Leonie Cuyler saw me do it.
While there I told her the story of her birth
and of mine to force her to keep my secret.
That was a great mistake on my part. I
should have found another way. Now what
are you going to do? If you pose as a martyr
I shall tell my story to the world of the tyrant
that you are in your family, where even
your own wife sits in fear and trembling.
You have but one virtue to commend you,
and that is half a vice&mdash;honesty, and even
that you carry no further than the negative
will cover. You are not dishonest so far as
money goes. You would have protected me?
Where was that poor woman, your brother's
wife, whom you let starve with her little
child, because she had married your brother
against your august will? Do you want that
story published to the world? I was only
waiting for matters to come to a head before
forcing you to my way of thinking in these
things.</p>

<p>"Now listen to me. If you refuse to do
what you can for me in this, I shall tell these
things of which I have spoken to the world;
I shall give them the true history of the unfortunate
cashier who robbed the bank in
Rochester, driven to it through your cruelty;
I shall tell them the story of Lillieth Dalworth,
your niece, whom you drove to suicide.
I do not ask anything of you after my
release from here, but I demand that. You
have the money to buy it, if you will. I
have no crime to answer for that is not bailable.
You understand what I mean. Do
that, and you will never hear of me again!"</p>

<p>She paused, looking at him defiantly.</p>

<p>He had remained very quiet during her
long harangue, and when she had finished, he
bowed courteously.</p>

<p>"I will do what I can for you," he said,
coldly.</p>

<p>A scornful smile curled her mouth.</p>

<p>She felt that she might have mastered him
long, if she had only had the courage, and
she took the chair that she had vacated with
a smile that was complacent, while she made
no attempt to veil its sneer.</p>

<p>"Is there anything else that you would
like to say?" he asked, quietly. "Is there no
message that you would like to send to the
woman who was a mother to you, and against
whom there is no charge that you can
bring?"</p>

<p>"I will take care of that!" said Miss Chandler,
airily.</p>

<p>Mr. Chandler took up his hat.</p>

<p>"Then I may bid you good-morning!" he
said, his manner unchanged. "You shall
hear from me later."</p>

<p>She bowed as he left the room.</p>

<p>He paused at the captain's desk outside.</p>

<p>"You told me as I came in," he said slowly,
calmly, "that there was no charge against
Miss Chandler by which she could be held,
and that she would be dismissed when she
was brought before the justice, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. I wish to make a charge
against her now&mdash;grand larceny!"</p>

<p>The captain started back in amazement.</p>

<p>"But sir&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more," returned Mr.
Chandler, coolly. "When you have made
out the complaint, I am ready to sign it, and
I should feel grateful if you will do it as
speedily as possible!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>While Miss Chandler sat there complacently
waiting for some one to conduct her back
to the cell where she had passed the early
morning hours, or tell her that the carriage
was waiting to take her to her home,
an officer in uniform entered, bearing a card.
He gave it to her with a ceremony that under
other circumstances might have been amusing.</p>

<p>She took it with a loftiness of bearing extremely
out of keeping with her unfortunate
position, and in the same manner that she
might have spoken the words to Leonard
Chandler's servant, she said:</p>

<p>"Admit him!"</p>

<p>A moment later Lynde Pyne was shown
in.</p>

<p>He came forward with extended hands and
kissed her as was his wont.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to express my sympathy
for you in a trial like this," he said gently.
"It must be horrible!"</p>

<p>"A ghastly sort of mistake," she replied,
with a little shuddering laugh intended to be
pretty. "I must apologize to you for the absurdity
of my dress. Fancy receiving one in
the morning in a gown like this."</p>

<p>Pyne gazed at her in absolute amazement.
Had she taken leave of her senses that she
could deliberately jest under circumstances
like those?</p>

<p>"It is nothing!" he stammered. "If you
were only out of this your gown would be the
last thing that I should think of. How did it
happen?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you when we are at home. This
room is comfortable enough for ordinary purposes,
but I don't like it."</p>

<p>"When&mdash;you are&mdash;at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My father has gone to arrange for
my immediate return."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;Mr. Chandler?"</p>

<p>"Whom else should I mean? Mr. Chandler,
to be sure."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;there must be some mistake."</p>

<p>"There is a mistake, of course. That goes
without saying, when I am an inmate of a
prison."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I&mdash;mean about Mr. Chandler. The
charge against you was made by him ten minutes
ago, and signed with his name."</p>

<p>Evelyn Chandler arose slowly from her
chair. Every particle of the color had slowly
left her cheeks, leaving her ghastly in pallor.
She gazed at Pyne as though convinced of his
insanity.</p>

<p>"You must be mad," she exclaimed, slowly,
the words falling from her lips like lead. "He
was here only a few minutes ago, and left me
with a promise that he would return at once.
You cannot be correct."</p>

<p>"I met him leaving the house, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before he could finish his sentence she flew
to the door and tore it open. The captain met
her there.</p>

<p>"Is it true that Leonard Chandler has entered
a charge against me?" she demand, her
voice sounding like nothing human in its terrible
hoarseness.</p>

<p>"Quite true!" returned the captain, with
perfect politeness.</p>

<p>"What charge?"</p>

<p>"Grand larceny."</p>

<p>The woman fell back against the casing of
the doorway.</p>

<p>She made a curious picture standing there
with that expression of hideous agony upon
her pallid features, her throat and shoulders
bare, her nude arms thrown upward.</p>

<p>There was not a man in the room who did
not admire her in spite of the serious charges
made against her. Lynde Pyne came to her
assistance, and tenderly drew her back into
the room, while he closed the door. She
raised herself in his arms after a moment of
inactivity, like a fiend.</p>

<p>"Let me go there!" she cried, madly. "Let
me tell them what he is! He has betrayed
me, and publicly in the courtroom I will tell
the world what he is. I will pay him for this
if it takes my life."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, dear!" exclaimed Lynde,
gently. "There is nothing that you can do
against him. Come! You will be summoned
to the courtroom in a few minutes for preliminary
examination. If you will allow me,
I will, of course, act for you; but you must
tell me all the evidence there is against you.
You must keep nothing from me, for therein
lies your only chance. Will you do it, Evelyn?"</p>

<p>She shrunk from him for a moment as
though in terror of even the sympathy she
read in his eyes; then she sprung forward like
a cat and caught him by the arm, lifting her
glistening eyes with intense excitement.</p>

<p>"I have your promise that you will marry
me!" she cried. "This does not release you.
Tell me that is does not?"</p>

<p>His face quivered with the agony that it
cost him to speak, but he replied bravely:</p>

<p>"The misfortune of the opposite party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
never releases one from a promise. I am
ready to keep my word when the conditions
of our contract shall have expired."</p>

<p>"Then you will do it at once&mdash;at once! A
will has been found that gives everything
your uncle possessed to you. The fortune
that millions could not cover is yours, and
Leonie is cleared of any complicity in the
crime of which she was, in a way, accused.
Are you ready to keep your word now?"</p>

<p>"The proofs are not yet in my hands, and
even if they were, the fortune to which you
refer is not mine. You forget that in the
papers which will be brought before the court
there will be one showing that my uncle left
an heir who can lay a claim before which the
strongest will could not stand."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean the claim of Leonie Cuyler
Pyne!"</p>

<p>"And you decline this fortune?"</p>

<p>"Emphatically I do!"</p>

<p>Her eyes glittered like those of a tigress.</p>

<p>"Then you intend to leave me to the fate
that that cursed fiend, Leonard Chandler, has
prepared for me?" she cried hoarsely. "You
intend to allow me to be sent to the penitentiary,
thinking that will cancel your promise
to me, and leave you free to marry the heiress.
That is it, is it?"</p>

<p>"You know that it is not!" exclaimed
Lynde almost roughly. "I have no more
idea of marrying Miss Pyne than I have of
marrying Juno. Don't talk so foolishly. I
am ready to do anything within the range of
human capability to help you."</p>

<p>"But you can do nothing without money&mdash;absolutely
nothing. You must take that
money or you must see me sent to prison."</p>

<p>"Once for all&mdash;I will not do it. Now let
that settle it forever. Are there any points
that you can give me to assist in your defense?
I do not ask you whether you are
guilty or not. At least, I shall give the benefit
of the doubt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" she cried shrilly. "You shall not
do even that. The proofs are so strong against
me, that if my innocence is proven it must
be bought. Witnesses must be purchased.
There is no other way. I am guilty! I am
guilty of all that and more, but if you don't
wish the woman whom you have sworn by a
solemn oath to make your wife, an ex-convict
when that ceremony is performed, you
must accept that money and save me. Leonie
knows the truth, Ben Mauprat knows it, that
woman, Liz, knows, and the letters that Ben
had not the sense to destroy, are against me.
How can you prove all those things liars without
money?"</p>

<p>"And is there not a single circumstance in
your favor?"</p>

<p>"Not one. I have grown honest at last in
that I can acknowledge it. Lynde, Lynde,
listen to me! I have borne it bravely, but I
am not brave. I am the greatest coward under
God's heaven. Oh, listen to me and save
me! I cannot go there to that prison, and
yet there is not a point for my defense. He
brought me up in luxury and idleness. I
knew nothing but wealth and plenty, so that
when that horrible man came, what was I
to do? He told me that my father was a forger
and my mother a thief. He threatened
to make those odious facts known unless I
furnished him with the money that he demanded.
I knew Leonard Chandler so well
that I was convinced that to have him hear
the story would be but to have him turn
eternally against me. He would not give me
the money that was required to buy my
father's silence, and my father would not remain
quiet without. What was I to do?
There was but one course left. I learned the
lesson that my parents taught. I was the offspring
of thieves, why should I be different
from them? Now, Lynde, you know the
truth. I have tried my best to appear stony,
but I am afraid. What am I to do? Oh, my
dear, if you leave me to my fate, I am lost
indeed! Lynde, promise that you will not!
Swear to me that you will save me! Swear
it, Lynde, by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear!" he whispered, laying his
hand across her mouth as she kneeled there
in front of him with her wild eyes raised appealingly.
"There is no need of an oath. You
may be sure that I shall do for you everything
that lies in my power. I will turn
heaven and earth to save you!"</p>

<p>"And if you fail," she continued, her teeth
chattering horribly, "what then? When I
am released from that place, when my life is
shadowed by the most awful curse that could
befall a mortal, you swear that you will take
me away? That you will not forget the promise
that you made long ago?"</p>

<p>If she saw the anguish of his face, it was of
small moment to her.</p>

<p>"A promise given is for all time, and under
all conditions and circumstances to me!" he
answered, huskily. "Let us end this scene,
Evelyn. I came here to find out what I was
to do to assist you, but it seems that I must
work in the dark. I may as well tell you
frankly that if this is all you have to say,
there is little hope. Is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before the sentence could be completed, the
officer entered to announce to them that the
hour had arrived for her appearance before
the judge.</p>

<p>With what calmness he could assume,
Lynde lifted her to her feet.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>The little dingy courtroom had never witnessed
such a crowd before as the one that
packed it from the justice's desk to the door,
and even out into the hall and down the dirty
steps.</p>

<p>Women, men and even little children, had
come to see Miss Evelyn Chandler, of whom
they had read in social circles, and many of
them seen, under arrest!</p>

<p>Her reception-dress was covered by the
long cloak that had concealed her gown when
she started upon that memorable visit to the
rooms of Ben Mauprat upon that fatal night.</p>

<p>A pair of long, black gloves covered her
hands, and a black hat with nodding plumes
shaded her lovely face.</p>

<p>She leaned upon the arm of Lynde Pyne
as she entered, pale, but composed, while he
was ghastly. Immediately behind her was
Luis Kingsley, haggard and gray of countenance,
while Leonie, followed by a policeman,
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>She still wore her masculine garments, but
with an air of timidity and modesty, now that
the world knew her sex.</p>

<p>She had scarcely made her appearance than
Andrew Pryor leaped forward, seizing her
effusively by the hand.</p>

<p>"You, Neil!" he cried, almost breaking into
tears in his delight. "This is the greatest
happiness of my life! How came you here?
Who has been getting you into trouble? I
knew that something had happened to you
when you did not come back; but thank the
Lord I've found you at last! How did you
happen to be here? Tell me all about it, my
boy, and I will see that you are released at
once!"</p>

<p>Leonie's face was crimson.</p>

<p>She could not keep from smiling, while tears
dimmed her vision.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you will find I have deceived
you, Mr. Pryor, and then I shall lose
the friendship that I have valued as one of
my best possessions, and I have few."</p>

<p>"You have deceived me?" he exclaimed.
"Nonsense! How have you deceived me?
I tell you, it is not possible! What is it that
they accuse you of? My friend Lynde Pyne
is here. He is a lawyer and he shall defend
you. Why, he has tried as hard to find you
as I have, and seemed even more interested.
Don't be afraid! He will get you out of here
soon enough!"</p>

<p>With utmost good nature he patted Leonie
upon the shoulder, and allowed her to take
the seat the officer indicated, turning his attention
to that individual.</p>

<p>"What is that boy accused of?" he asked.
"He is as innocent as I am! Never did a
wrong thing in his life!"</p>

<p>"That is no boy!" answered the policeman
with a short laugh; "that is a girl."</p>

<p>Mr. Pryor staggered back as though the
officer had threatened to arrest him.</p>

<p>"A girl!" he gasped. "Have you all gone
mad? Why, that boy is Neil Lowell, and he
worked for me as my private secretary. He
is the best fellow in existence, and never did
a wrong act in his life!"</p>

<p>"She is a girl, for all that!" returned the
officer, serenely.</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor sat down very suddenly.
He seemed to be utterly overcome by the intelligence
he had received.</p>

<p>His eyes were riveted upon Leonie as
though they could never be removed.</p>

<p>Then by degrees he began to put certain circumstances
together.</p>

<p>He remembered the refusal to attend the
stag supper, and a smile came to his face;
that was followed by many other minor
things that all seemed important now, then
his hand came down upon his knee with peculiar
force.</p>

<p>"And Pyne knew it all the time!" he exclaimed,
below his breath, with a firmness
that left no room for contradiction. "I see
it all now as clearly as can be. Of course he
knew! Well, this beats a novel!"</p>

<p>His reflections were cut short by the opening
of court!</p>

<p>There is so great a sameness about such
trials that there is little to tell of the occurrences
of the next hour or more.</p>

<p>Leonie was discharged for want of evidence
against her, but Evelyn Chandler and
Luis Kingsley were both held to wait the action
of the Grand Jury, the one to answer to
the charge of grand larceny, the other of
felonious concealment of a will.</p>

<p>There was great excitement evidenced when
Leonard Chandler took the stand against his
adopted daughter, but the questions that were
put to him were few, and answered in a tone
that was not audible to those twenty feet removed
from him.</p>

<p>Then there was a murmur of voices when
Lynde Pyne asked for bail for his client,
which was strenuously opposed by Leonard
Chandler on the ground that she had demanded
it of him, expressing a determination to
leave the state before the trial.</p>

<p>Thereupon the bail was fixed at a figure
that Pyne could not cover, since the will had
not yet been admitted to probate, and the
money was not his until it had.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler and Kingsley were therefore
placed in the hands of officers of the court to
be conducted back to prison.</p>

<p>"Take courage!" Lynde whispered to her
at parting. "What can be done for you I
will do, you may be sure of that. I will procure
the bail and you will be released within
a few hours at most."</p>

<p>She had scarcely left his presence than he
turned to look for Leonie.</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor was holding her firmly by
the hands while she half smiled into his face.</p>

<p>"You little rascal&mdash;I mean witch!" he exclaimed.
"Why did you not tell me of this
long ago? Did you feel that you could not
trust me? It is the most extraordinary thing
I ever heard of! Where did you get the information
that enabled you to do a man's
work?"</p>

<p>"You forget that I was a typewriter for a
number of years, and that I learned a man's
business through copying it for him," she answered,
deeply affected by his kindness.</p>

<p>"You are coming right home with me.
You shall still be my private secretary if you
are a girl."</p>

<p>"You are so good, sir!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it all, I forgot about the fortune
you will have now, and that you will not
have need of me any longer. I am half sorry
for the good fortune that robs me of you."</p>

<p>"I am as poor as I was before, Mr. Pryor,
and if you will allow me to return to you,
you will save me many hours of distress over
what my future is to be. I am forced to earn
my living now as formerly."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, how is that?"</p>

<p>"Changing my male attire for that of a
girl will not alter my circumstances, unfortunately."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it, but come home, and
we will talk it over there. Mrs. Pryor has
been just as anxious about you as I have, and
will be as glad to see you. So will the girls,
though hanged if I don't believe they will be
disappointed at the change in your sex, for
they were all more than half in love with
you. Besides that, you have a cousin
there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And another here, that you will not give
an opportunity of speaking to her," interrupted
Pyne. "You must not be so selfish, Mr.
Pryor. You believe me that I am glad to find
in you a cousin, do you not, Leonie? I congratulate
you from the bottom of my heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>She placed her hand in his proffered one
without lifting her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is so good of you!" she returned gently.
"I realize how hard it must be for you
when you remember that my mother's disgrace
is the first that has ever stained your
noble family. Perhaps some day you will let
me tell you the story, and then you may find
a little sympathy for the woman who was
driven to the act of which she was guilty to
save her child from starving."</p>

<p>"And my uncle allowed that torture to
rest upon his wife? I wonder that you can
look upon one of us, knowing that it was
one of our blood that caused you such suffering!"</p>

<p>"It was not his fault."</p>

<p>"This is not the time to speak of things like
those!" Mr. Pryor cut in. "I am going to take
her home with me now, Pyne. You will know
where to find her when you want to see her,
and you also know that you will be always
welcome."</p>

<p>They shook hands again and separated.</p>

<p>Andrew Pryor led Leonie, still in her ragged
costume, down to his carriage, placed her inside
with old-school courtesy, and gave the
order for "home."</p>

<p>"I can hardly realize it," he exclaimed,
when he had closed the door, "that you are
really a girl! What a surprise it will be to
Mrs. Pryor and the girls. And you put on
that costume as a sort of private detective?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I put it on because after I discovered
Miss Chandler to be dishonest I was
arrested as an accomplice, and in order not to
be forced to tell my story, I ran away. I did
it for safety! What I have discovered about
my birth, came to me as the result of accident!"</p>

<p>"A remarkably timely accident! If I can
curb my curiosity until we get home, I must
hear all about where you went when you
left my house, and how you happened to be
detained. I shall keep you talking for a
week."</p>

<p>"There is just one thing that I must do
first of all if you will let me," returned Leonie,
almost reverently, "and that is to pay a visit
to Liz. Poor woman! But for her, I might
still have been there in that room surrounded
by rats and beaten almost to death by that
demon, Mauprat. I have felt within the last
few hours as though the life of that helpless
child of hers had been the price of my
freedom and of Lynde's restoration to his
fortune."</p>

<p>"Lynde's restoration?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly. And it seems to me that
I owe her a debt that never can be repaid for
that, not to speak of her great kindness to
me. But for her I think I should have gone
mad."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course you shall pay the visit.
That is all right, but what is this about Lynde's
fortune? Surely you know that if you prove
yourself the daughter of Roger Pyne the
money is yours."</p>

<p>"The money is not mine, sir. My father
never even knew of my existence, and I have
no more right to the money than you have.
Surely a man has the privilege of leaving
money that is his where he wishes. But I
tell you this, that right or wrong, I would put
my hand in the fire and burn it off before I
touch a cent of it. It was never intended for
me, and I will have nothing to do with it.
Please say nothing more about it, but let this
settle it forever!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>Notwithstanding the extreme cordiality
of her reception by Andrew Pryor, Leonie felt,
naturally, some misgivings regarding the welcome
she would receive from the feminine
portion of the household.</p>

<p>She was, however, prepared for anything,
and it was with a most thankful heart that
she heard the exclamations of delight that
were unanimous when she was seen at the
door of the drawing-room in company with
Mr. Pryor.</p>

<p>Doffing the ragged cap that covered her
head, she smilingly received the welcome of
Mrs. Pryor, followed by that of the young
ladies, and grasped the hand of Miss Pyne
with suspicious warmth as it was extended
last.</p>

<p>"I don't know what we should do with you
for giving us the fright that you have!" cried
Mrs. Pryor, warmly. "I honestly think that
Mr. Pryor has not slept a night since you left
us so unceremoniously."</p>

<p>Leonie colored vividly, and even Mr. Pryor
looked a trifle sheepish.</p>

<p>"Before you make any more such remarks
as that, my dear," he exclaimed, laughingly,
"you had better let me tell you the romance
that clings to my private secretary! He is
not a man at all, but a young woman who
happens to be the first cousin of our little
friend here, Miss Edith Pyne!"</p>

<p>If he intended to create a sensation, as of
course he did, his object was achieved to its
fullest extent.</p>

<p>There was not a word spoken in the room
for many moments, Mrs. Pryor being the first
to break the silence.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand it at all!" she cried.
"Is not this Neil Lowell?"</p>

<p>Leonie stepped forward, her brow colored
crimson.</p>

<p>"I don't think that I should have had the
courage to face you after my deception, dear
Mrs. Pryor," she said, timidly, "but for the
cordiality of your husband. If you will allow
me, when I have more time than now, I
will explain to you the reason for my assuming
male attire and passing myself off upon
your kindness in a false light. I hope you
will forgive me."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive, absolutely
nothing! And you are really the cousin of
Edith Pyne?"</p>

<p>"You read that remarkable story in the
papers this morning, did you not?" cut in
Mr. Pryor. "Well, this is the child of that
marriage. You may be sure the papers will
contain many sensational points to-morrow
that they failed to get to-day, and New York
will be more surprised than it has been for
many days."</p>

<p>"I don't know what your name is, Neil
Lowell," exclaimed Edith, with a merry
laugh, "but I am very much pleased that
you are my cousin, and before you take off
your boy's clothes, I should like to kiss you!"</p>

<p>There was general merriment, of course,
but Mrs. Pryor's next question put an end to
it.</p>

<p>"And Miss Chandler," she said, "what had
she to do with it?"</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, then Andrew
Pryor answered:</p>

<p>"This young lady is in haste to pay a call.
While she goes to change her dress I will tell
you all that! Gwen, or the one of you that is
nearest your size, will furnish you with
clothes, my dear, until your wardrobe can be
changed. Run away now, and be back as
quickly as you can."</p>

<p>Understanding the kindness of the intention,
Leonie gave him a glance of gratitude,
and followed the girls from the room.</p>

<p>Laughing, chatting, asking a hundred
questions in as many seconds, they went on
their way as though they had been friends
for life, and it was with a heart filled with
the sincerest of gratitude, that Leonie realized
that she had found friends at last, friends
who would never fail her in her bitter struggle
with loneliness and isolation.</p>

<p>They soon found a gown that would fit,
and not long afterward she announced to
them that she must make her call at the
hospital.</p>

<p>The carriage was ordered to the door, and
she was driven away with as much ceremony
and respect as though she were a member of
the family, where she was in reality but a dependent.</p>

<p>But as she rode onward her thoughts fled
from her own good fortune to that unhappy
woman who had done so much to aid her in
securing that which was more to her than her
life, and a great sadness took possession of
her.</p>

<p>How good God was to her, giving her
name and friends when she had lost all hope,
yet how far He seemed from that poor creature
lying there knowing that she must die,
and that the child whom she had so much
loved had preceded her.</p>

<p>The beautiful eyes filled with tears as the
carriage stopped.</p>

<p>She explained to the person in charge of
the building who she was, and was admitted
to the ward in which poor Liz lay upon one of
the little, white-draped cots.</p>

<p>Very quietly Leonie approached her, and,
kneeling beside the bed, kissed her upon the
forehead.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Liz?" she asked
gently.</p>

<p>The woman smiled feebly, making an effort
to extend her hand.</p>

<p>"I did not until you spoke!" she answered
weakly; "but nothing could ever cause me
to forget that voice. You are Leonie; but
how changed you are."</p>

<p>"Borrowed plumes make changes in us all!
They have told you of the terrible things that
happened last night, have they not, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they came to take my statement&mdash;<i>ante-mortem</i>,
I think they call it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Liz! I hope it may not be true! Do
not you know, dear, how we had planned to
go away and live together? If you will only
get well, Liz, we can do that now."</p>

<p>The smile upon the poor tired face deepened.</p>

<p>"That was before Dick died," she replied,
with as much cheerfulness as a rapidly dying
woman can express.</p>

<p>"But you would need me all the more
now!"</p>

<p>"No. I shall never trouble any one again.
God has been very good to me, after all,
Leonie. He knew that I could never live
without Dick, and he placed a means in my
power without making me responsible for it.
They tell me that I sprung out that window,
but I have no remembrance of it, and I know
that He will not hold me guilty. My boy is
waiting for me, Leonie, just across the river,
and when I close my eyes I can see him as
distinctly as I can you, only that he is robbed
of his deformity and his rags. It does not
seem like little Dick, and yet I know that it
is he. The Lord has sent him to help his
mother safely over. I have not lived a guiltless
life, Leonie, but for Dick's sake the Lord
will forgive."</p>

<p>"And you are not afraid, Liz?" whispered
Leonie, the awe of her tone making it extremely
low.</p>

<p>"Afraid of my God?" returned the woman
wonderingly. "Afraid of Heaven when I
have known such torture here upon earth?
Oh, no! I have been praying to God to have
mercy upon Ben and send him repentance.
That is my one torture now that I am dying.
I have not forgotten you, dear, and I never
shall; but here, just at the last, when I remember
all the wickedness of his life, I do
not see how God ever could forgive him!"</p>

<p>"And yet you can!"</p>

<p>"Upon that I found my hope. Oh, Leonie,
it seems so sweet to know that it is all over
and done with at last. All the old heartaches,
the terror, the fear lest Ben should kill
my poor, helpless baby. No one but God could
ever know what a hideous nightmare it was,
but it will be over now in a few hours at most.
I hope you may be happy, my dear girl, and
that we may meet in that heaven that is promised
to us all."</p>

<p>"I almost wish that I could go with you,"
whispered Leonie, choking back her sobs.
"There is so little of happiness here, and so
much promised there. I know that I am ungrateful
to Heaven for all the kind friends
that have been sent me, but my mother is up
there, Liz, and sometimes the desire is so
strong upon me to see her and Dad, to be with
them again, that I can scarcely control it."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten them. I shall see them
before you will, dear."</p>

<p>"Yes, and if you can deliver them a message
for me, tell them that I ought to be happy,
that I am ungrateful, but that the whole
craving of my heart is to be with them and
with God. Tell them that I have and shall do
only what I believe they would advise and
wish me to do. Oh, Liz, I wish that I might
go with you!"</p>

<p>There was something curiously touching in
that scene, so simple and yet so explicit in its
faith. There was not the smallest doubt in
the heart of either.</p>

<p>The dying woman reached up her arms and
clasped them about the girlish neck.</p>

<p>"Not yet, dear," she whispered. "Life
should hold many things that are precious to
one so beautiful and so good as you. Heaven
has not forgotten you. Only trust it all to
God. But when the good days come, do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
forget Him in your enjoyment. Remember
that the hour that I am awaiting almost impatiently
now must come to you at last."</p>

<p>Leonie was weeping softly. Her very heart
seemed breaking.</p>

<p>She had never seemed so utterly alone since
that night upon which her grandfather had
left her to battle with life alone.</p>

<p>The friends she had left seemed to count as
nothing in that hour.</p>

<p>She could scarcely control an hysterical
sobbing, but for Liz's sake she knew she
must.</p>

<p>She lay there with her head upon the dying
woman's pillow, the feeble hands straying
softly over the short hair from which the hat
had fallen.</p>

<p>Suddenly the motion ceased.</p>

<p>There were a few whispered words that
Leonie did not catch, then a hand was placed
gently upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>She lifted her head and saw beside her an
attendant&mdash;a sweet-faced, low-voiced woman.</p>

<p>"It is all over!" she whispered reverently.</p>

<p>With a horrified expression, Leonie gazed
at the face upon the pillow.</p>

<p>A peaceful smile hovered upon it. The lips
were open, and a dimple rested in the left
cheek as it had been in girlhood.</p>

<p>"Liz!" Leonie whispered, "Liz!"</p>

<p>But there was no answer.</p>

<p>She slipped from beneath the hand that the
attendant had laid upon her arm, and fell to
the floor, her bright, beautiful head falling
across Liz's bosom.</p>

<p>Most tenderly she was lifted and carried
from the room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>"Lynde is down-stairs, asking for you,
Leonie. I don't think you are well enough
to see him, but Mr. Pryor insisted that I
should ask you. What shall I say to him,
dear?"</p>

<p>Edith Pyne bent and kissed her cousin
affectionately, as she asked the question, and
Leonie's eyes filled with tears. Kindness had
never seemed to affect her so much as since the
death of poor Liz, and she had never received
more of it. They all seemed to vie with each
other in their attempts to do most to make
her comfortable, and in consequence kept her
in a state bordering on hysteria.</p>

<p>"I will go down to see him, of course," she
returned, with a little quiet smile. "You are
all too good to me. You will make a perfect
baby of me if this continues."</p>

<p>She arose, and assisted by Edith, made her
way down-stairs; but at the door of the library
the support was withdrawn, and she was left
to enter alone.</p>

<p>She did not notice the fact, as she thought
she should find all the family gathered there,
if she thought of it at all; but she seemed to
understand when she saw that the room contained
Lynde Pyne alone.</p>

<p>A dainty crimson overspread her face, but
controlling her timidity, she entered and
quietly placed her hand in the one extended.</p>

<p>Lynde drew her down beside him upon a
sofa before either of them spoke.</p>

<p>"I expected to see you more exhausted,
after the trying scenes through which you
have passed," he said gently. "I am pleased
to see you looking so well."</p>

<p>"Edith and the rest have been trying to persuade
me that I was in a fit state for rapid decline,
or nervous prostration," she answered,
with an attempt at lightness. "It is quite a
relief to hear you say to the contrary."</p>

<p>"Not at all. I never saw you look better."</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I cannot say the same for
you. You seem harrassed, haggard. Tell me,
will you not, how things are going? I have
been so anxious to know; but no one knew, or
if they did, refused to tell me."</p>

<p>"It has distressed me! I never knew how
few friends I had until now. I cannot procure
the amount of bail required for&mdash;Evelyn,
and surely you know what the result of that
will be. She is in the Tombs in a state of
mind bordering upon insanity. I know that
I should not tell you this, and yet, you may be
able to help me. The men whom I have accounted
my friends refuse to go on the bond
for me, saying that she would but escape, and
I should be left with an amount to pay that
would ruin me, as, of course, I have offered
to make the amount good in the event of an
accident. Even Mr. Pryor swears at me when
I insist upon it that he must do as I say. But
if you would speak to him the effect might be
different."</p>

<p>"It is so good of you to take this interest in
her. If there is anything that I can do, you
may be sure that I will with all my heart.
Oh, Lynde, I tried so hard to spare her. I entreated
her to see the condition in which she
was placing herself, but she would not. Why,
upon the night that we were all arrested, I
told her of the papers that were in my possession&mdash;papers
that I had no wish should ever
come before the public. I did not even ask
her to resign her position as the daughter of
Leonard Chandler, but I could not see her become
your wife knowing that she was a&mdash;&mdash; I
cannot say the word. The thought of it is
hideous to me!"</p>

<p>"But it has not released me from my promise,
Leonie."</p>

<p>"What! You would not marry her now?"</p>

<p>"I must."</p>

<p>"You are mad!"</p>

<p>"I sometimes think I am going mad! She
holds the most solemn pledge from me that
man could give to woman, and I have not the
power to break it. But let us leave this subject!
It is not a safe one for you and me to
speak upon. You will do what you can with
Mr. Pryor?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"There was another thing that I wished to
speak to you about. I have engaged one of
my friends, a lawyer of considerable prominence,
to examine the original records and
prove that your mother's marriage to Ben
Mauprat was not legal, in order that your
claim to the fortune your father left may not
admit of question. It may be rather painful
for you, but be assured that all will be done
to spare your feelings that can be. You will
trust me for that, will you not?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I quite understand you.
You say that you have engaged a lawyer for
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To prove my claim to the fortune your
uncle left?"</p>

<p>"To the fortune your father left."</p>

<p>"No one can lay a claim to that in my
name without my sanction, can they?"</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"And I have authorized no one to do it. I
have already said that I have no right to that
money, and no intention of having it! It is
yours, and yours it shall remain."</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment in stupefied
silence, then placed his hand very gently on
hers.</p>

<p>"And you think that I am so little a man
that I would receive what is yours by every
right under Heaven? You think that I would
rob a girl to enrich myself?"</p>

<p>She lifted her sweet eyes pleadingly.</p>

<p>"It is not that!" she cried earnestly. "It
was never meant for me, and I should always
feel that I was using that to which I had no
right, that I was living upon charity so to
speak! It would eternally hang like a stone
about my neck, dragging me to a premature
death. You must not ask me to do it, Lynde,
for indeed I cannot!"</p>

<p>"But consider, dear; even were I to do the
contemptible thing you wish, your heirs
could one day come forward and demand
their rights of me, and there is not a law
under the sun that would not give it to them.
You see I should but become a trustee, after
all, responsible in the years to come for that
of which, very likely, I should not take the
best of care. There is nothing for it, Leonie,
but for you to accept that which is yours by
every right, and of which you have been
robbed so long."</p>

<p>Her lovely face had grown almost sullen.</p>

<p>A slow, determined light was burning in her
eyes, her hand loosened itself from his, and
she arose slowly to her feet.</p>

<p>"If that is all that you have come to say,
let me settle it with you as I have with Mr.
Pryor, who has ceased to bother me upon the
subject. I will not touch one cent of that
money. I did not sell my sister to a prison
for the sake of gaining a few paltry dollars,
and I will not have it appear even to myself
that I did. If there were no other reason than
that, it would still be enough."</p>

<p>Lynde arose and stood before her.</p>

<p>His face was deadly pale and quivering
with the suppression he was putting upon himself,
but he was very quiet, for all that.</p>

<p>"It seems too absurd," he said slowly, "for
us to be standing here fighting like two children
over who shall and who shall not have
the money. Your argument is unreasonable.
You might as well say that I am selling my
cousin to a prison in that I contemplate prosecuting
him for the concealment of his knowledge
in this affair. There is just one thing
that I wish to say to you, and that is that I
shall never touch a dollar of the money which
no more belongs to me than it does to Evelyn
Chandler. If you wish Luis Kingsley to have
possession of it, a man who until a few days
ago, was a stranger to you, why, I have nothing
to say."</p>

<p>She looked at him for some time incredulously,
then:</p>

<p>"You don't really mean that!" she exclaimed.
"You would never do anything so
mad!"</p>

<p>"It contains less of madness than the absurdity
you contemplate. I swear to you
that I do mean it. I will never touch it!"</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, her eyes filling
with tears, then went a step toward him, laying
her hand upon his arm timidly.</p>

<p>"At least we can come to a compromise,
Cousin Lynde," she said, with strong emphasis
upon the relationship. "The money
was left to you; you say it is mine by right
of my unfortunate birth, which never was
intended. Very well! I will agree to accept
one-half if you will take the other. Surely
you can see the justice in that! I tell you
frankly, that if you refuse, Luis Kingsley
may have the money!"</p>

<p>He saw that she meant it.</p>

<p>If he only could have said to her what
was in his heart! If he only had had the
privilege to propose to her the compromise
that was hovering upon his lips, he would
have felt himself the happiest of men, but
honor closed his lips.</p>

<p>He had not answered her, when Andrew
Pryor entered.</p>

<p>"Well!" he exclaimed, "what understanding
have you two arrived at?"</p>

<p>"None!" returned Leonie, turning to him,
desperately. "Oh, sir, I wish you would
make him see that I am right and he is wrong!
I wish you would make him understand how
impossible it is for me to do as he thinks I
should! You see it as I do, do you not? At
least he should take half!"</p>

<p>"That seems to me fair enough, Lynde, unless
you could name a different compromise!"</p>

<p>He laughed as the remark was made, but
would have recalled it if he could, when he
saw the expression of both countenances.</p>

<p>"You must give me time to think of it!"
cried Pyne, speaking hastily, to cover his confusion.
"That is a proposition that I never
thought of before. I will call about it to-morrow;
and in the meantime, Leonie, see what
you can do about the other matter that I spoke
to you of, will you not?"</p>

<p>She was about to reply, when the door
opened to admit a servant, followed by a
messenger.</p>

<p>"For Mr. Pyne!" the servant announced,
handing the brownish envelope to Lynde.</p>

<p>"Have I your permission?" asked Pyne,
glancing from Leonie to Mr. Pryor, as he held
the message in his hand.</p>

<p>Receiving their permission, he tore the end
off and read hastily. A frown contracted his
brow; then, with the ghastliness of death
covering his face, he read it aloud:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Pyne</span>,&mdash;A message just came for
you from the Tombs to the effect that a terrible
thing has happened there, and your presence
is desired at once. From all accounts
you need not distress yourself further about
bail for your fair client. I send this to Mr.
Pryor's in the hope that it may find you.</p>

<p class="sig0">
"Yours in haste,<br />
</p><p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Downing</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Neither of the distressed listeners spoke until
he had reached the door to answer the imperative
call. Then, with a bound, Leonie
was beside him.</p>

<p>"If anything has happened you will let me
know, will you not?" she asked, her voice
not more than a whisper. "You know what I
mean. I should like to see her before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let us hope that it is nothing of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
kind!" returned Lynde, his throat seeming to
close over the words. "Surely God will give
her time for repentance!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<p>The drive from the residence of Andrew
Pryor to the Tombs was a long one, and almost
an hour had elapsed from the time of
his leaving there until Lynde Pyne arrived at
the big, gloomy prison.</p>

<p>He went at once to the official there, and
told of the summons that had been sent him.</p>

<p>Then it was that he heard the story of what
had happened.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler had stuck a knife through
her throat!</p>

<p>Where she had procured it, no one was able
to say, but certain it was that the deed had
been done, and that she had been removed to
the prison hospital.</p>

<p>With set face and anxious heart, Lynde
made his way to that quarter that he had
visited more than once in his practice, a visit
that had always been attended with horror,
but now a thousand times more than ever.</p>

<p>He was shown to the cot whereon the once
famous beauty rested, her drawn face now
whiter than the drapery of her cot.</p>

<p>The eyes were closed, the sheet pulled up so
that none of the disfiguring bandages about
the shapely throat could be seen.</p>

<p>"Is she sleeping?" he asked of the physician
who stood beside him.</p>

<p>"One can never tell. She lies like that all
the time, and will answer no questions that
are put to her."</p>

<p>"Will she&mdash;live?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! There is no reason why she
should not! At first I was very positive it
would be a fatal case, but we succeeded in
stanching the blood sooner than I hoped for.
She has lost a great deal however, and could
not have stood much more. We have to watch
her all the time, however, for fear she will attempt
it again, and another opening of the
artery would certainly prove fatal."</p>

<p>"Have I your permission to speak to her if
she will answer me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, only you must be careful that
she does not exert herself in the very least.
Keep her in exactly the position that she now
is, and if the slightest thing should happen, I
will be within call. If she should take it into
her head to talk to you, do not allow her to
utter more than a few words at a time and
those very softly; you understand?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"I shall be only out of earshot."</p>

<p>He walked away as he finished speaking,
and Lynde took the chair beside Evelyn's bed.
Her eyes opened almost at once.</p>

<p>"He said that I should not die," she said
slowly, and with great difficulty of articulation,
"but he lied! I will die. When a
woman is determined upon a thing like that,
there are not men enough in the world to
prevent it."</p>

<p>"You must not say that, dear," exclaimed
Lynde, gently. "He only wants to save your
life for your own good. I think I have succeeded
in securing bail for you, and you must
get well now in order that we can determine
what is best to do for you."</p>

<p>"From whom did you get it?" she stammered,
faintly.</p>

<p>"From&mdash;your sister, whose deepest sympathy
you have."</p>

<p>"Leonie?"</p>

<p>The word was a gasp, the expression of the
countenance set with horror.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p>"Never!" she cried, as vehemently as the
circumstances would allow. "Do you think
I would owe my liberty to her? Not if I died
like a dog, as I shall! You have all forsaken
me and lied to me. You who pretended that
you would protect me above every one upon
earth. Do you think I did not know that you
were not trying to get bail for me? You
thought that you could deceive me until you
succeeded in having me sentenced to the penitentiary,
and then you would do as you liked.
You would leave me and marry her. Well, I
decided that I would not go there. I knew
that there was but one way to save myself
from it, and I took that means. That old fool
told you just now that I should get well. I
tell you that I shall not, and you and my dear
sister"&mdash;with a disfiguring sneer&mdash;"may look
upon yourselves as my murderers! Why did
she not come here with you? I want to tell
her before I die the price that she has paid for
her husband."</p>

<p>"Evelyn, for God's sake think what you
are saying! You know that Leonie is not
guilty of your horrible charge!"</p>

<p>"She is guilty of that and more. But for
her I should have been at home and happy
now, but she thought that I was the fortunate
one, and she thrust herself upon me, determining
that she would rob me of everything
that made life a joy. She has succeeded. Go
and bring her here! I want her to see the result
of it all! I want to see her glory in her
own work here before my eyes before I die!
I want her to see what a thing she has made
of her sister, and I want her to know that my
blood rests upon her head."</p>

<p>"If you do not cease this, I shall call the
physician and leave you!" Lynde exclaimed
almost angrily.</p>

<p>"Will you bring her here?"</p>

<p>"No! I most emphatically will not!"</p>

<p>"Then I shall ask the doctor."</p>

<p>"It would be useless, for I should decline
to allow her to come!"</p>

<p>He was unprepared for what followed his
speech.</p>

<p>Before he could catch her, or in any way
stay the mad act, she had leaped from her
cot upon the opposite side from him, and had
torn the bandages from her throat, then
catching her finger in the stitches that held
the long wound together, she ripped them
open.</p>

<p>Only insanity could have given her the
courage to have accomplished an act so deliberate
in its atrocity.</p>

<p>Pyne uttered a gasp of horror and sat still
as though paralyzed. The doctor, from the
other side of the room, saw the act.</p>

<p>Like a flash he sprung up and rushed desperately
after her; but she eluded him, a
laugh like the fiendish yell of an infuriated
animal sounding upon the stillness of the
room. It seemed to arouse Lynde.</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet, and together they
succeeded in catching her and forcing her
down upon the cot, where she was bound;
but it required their united strength to do it,
and then only when the floor and bed-clothing
were saturated with blood.</p>

<p>"She is a raving maniac!" the doctor ejaculated,
pausing to wipe the perspiration from
his brow.</p>

<p>Bound as she was, the hideous laughter
continued to fall from her rapidly paling
lips.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he exclaimed to Lynde. "Go
for assistance. Tell some one to bring my
surgical instruments. There is not a moment
to lose!"</p>

<p>But the moment had already passed.</p>

<p>The horrible laughter grew fainter and
fainter, and at last ceased altogether.</p>

<p>The struggling grew weaker, and she lay
very quietly when they leaned over her
again.</p>

<p>She had fainted, but it was a swoon from
which she never recovered.</p>

<p>They sat there beside her, doing what mortal
men could do to restore her, but to no purpose.</p>

<p>The end came without a return to consciousness
something like half an hour later.</p>

<p>"It is much better that it should have been
so," the physician said consolingly. "She
very likely would never have recovered her
mental faculties, and even had she, the horror
of an awakening would have been worse
than death. She was too frail of constitution
ever to have endured the tortures of
prison life."</p>

<p>"But to die like that without a prayer for
mercy!" murmured Lynde, shudderingly.</p>

<p>"It would never have been different. If
you grieve, my dear boy, you are very foolish.
The kindest act God ever performed for
her was in allowing her to die."</p>

<p>"Can it be kept from the papers?" asked
Lynde, after a long pause.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not. Her last words you
alone heard, consequently they rest with you,
but the manner of her death must of course
be reported, and the papers will naturally
want the conclusion of so startling a story.
I suspected that it would be something like
this, for I believed the act to be that of a
lunatic in the beginning. My belief is that
she has been insane for years, though that,
and the manner of her obtaining the knife
with which the deed was done, must forever
remain a mystery."</p>

<p>"It is more charitable to believe it so."</p>

<p>"God help her, it is her one chance in eternity.
I hope that it may have been so."</p>

<p>Deep in his heart Lynde uttered a solemn
"Amen!"</p>

<p>If he could not profoundly regret an occurrence
that had rid his life of a contemplation
that was more hideous than death, he was not
to blame, for he had tried to do his duty
nobly, though only he himself could have told
what a frightful prospect it contained.</p>

<p>Very gently he told the story to Leonie,
concealing in his own heart that which he
knew would cause her the greatest sorrow.</p>

<p>He told her that her sister had died violently
insane, because he believed there would be
a germ of comfort in the knowledge.</p>

<p>She was deeply affected, not because there
had ever been, or could ever have been any
affection between them, but because there
were no words of forgiveness, and because
she blamed herself to a great extent for the
untimely end and the grewsome circumstances
that led to it.</p>

<p>"There is one thing more," she said sadly,
when the subject had been talked over for
some time. "Mr. and Mrs. Chandler should
be told. In spite of all, I feel that the death
will strike them very closely home, and either
you or I must tell them, Lynde. Don't you
think so?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right. They knew of
my relations with her, and Mr. Chandler is
not kindly disposed toward me. It might be
better for you, though I will not ask it if you
had rather not."</p>

<p>"I will go. It should be done now, don't
you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If left until to-morrow, the papers
will do it for us. God bless you, Leonie."</p>

<p>She hurried from the room quickly, that
he might not see the tears that had gathered
in her eyes.</p>

<p>She was not altogether unhappy.</p>

<p>She knew so well how much that death
meant to her, but she tried to put that thought
from her.</p>

<p>It was her sister who was dead&mdash;her sister
whom, if she had not loved her, was yet her
mother's child.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, the horrible remembrance
came to her.</p>

<p>In the place where the mother had died, the
daughter who had despised her memory followed.</p>

<p>She sat down half paralyzed under the
fearful thought that, after all, it was the
"retribution" of which the old Mosaic law
has spoken.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Leonie had returned from her visit to the
Chandlers.</p>

<p>Her eyes showed traces of weeping, and her
countenance contained the radiant glow of a
saint that has received the gift of righteousness
through suffering.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Pryor, and the Misses Pryor,
together with Lynde and Edith Pyne, were in
the library awaiting her, and as she entered
she was warmly greeted, and a comfortable
chair placed for her.</p>

<p>"You look tired and worn, dear!" exclaimed
Mrs. Pryor, with motherly kindness. "I
think it would be much better for you to go
up-stairs and take a much-needed rest, than
allow yourself to be tormented by these careless
young people."</p>

<p>"I had rather remain, if you will allow
me," returned Leonie, meekly. "I don't think
I could rest, and I should not like to be alone.
This is ever so much better, where I can feel
what kind friends and true the Lord has sent
me in my loneliness."</p>

<p>"And Leonard Chandler!" cut in Mr. Pryor,
unable to curb his curiosity. "What did he
say?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you how deeply he feels it
all!" exclaimed Leonie, sadly. "I think, had
he been her father, his grief could not have
been greater. He feels that to a great extent
he is blamable for what has occurred. Mrs.
Chandler is almost in hysteria. She was under
the care of the physician when I left.
Evelyn's conduct is all the more remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to me, when I think of the loving tenderness
that must have been hers in the home of her
adoption. My heart has ached until it has
seemed almost breaking. Mr. Chandler has
asked my permission to have the body removed
at once to his house, and buried from
there."</p>

<p>"And you gave it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; what right had I compared
with theirs, even had I chosen to press my
claim? They were so kind to me! Why, it
seemed almost as though they were accepting
me in her stead. When I was leaving Mrs.
Chandler clasped her arms about my neck,
and with tears streaming over her face said:
'You must fill her place, dear. Remember
that I shall have no daughter now. My heart
and home will both be empty. You must fill
the vacancy that her death has left!' I don't
know what I have done that so many friends
should be given me, just at the time when I
fancied myself most alone!"</p>

<p>"It is very nice of the Chandlers, indeed!"
cried Mr. Pryor, dryly. "I don't doubt in
the least but that it would be charming for
them to have you take their daughter's place,
but there are others who have a 'pryor'
claim, eh, Lucretia?"</p>

<p>He smiled over his little joke, and Mrs.
Pryor nodded her head approvingly.</p>

<p>"Do you realize, girls," she said, sweetly,
"that it is less than an hour until dinner?
Remember your father's horror of a cold dinner,
and take yourselves away to dress at
once!"</p>

<p>There was a general movement in obedience
to the command, but as Leonie was about to
follow them, she felt a hand placed very gently
upon her arm.</p>

<p>"Won't you wait a minute, please?" Lynde
asked, half timidly. "I shall detain you
only a few seconds."</p>

<p>She tried to prevent the crimson from rushing
over her face as she felt it doing, but the
effort was without avail.</p>

<p>The others passed from the room as though
they had not observed the aside.</p>

<p>"There were a few questions that I wanted
to ask you about the&mdash;funeral," Lynde stammered,
when they were alone and the door
had been closed. "I thought, perhaps, you
might not care to have it talked of before the
others. Will Mr. and Mrs. Chandler attend
to everything, or do you do it?"</p>

<p>"They wished it all to be just as though
none of this horrible recent past had taken
place. They believe with me that she has
been insane for years."</p>

<p>"That is all, then. And, Leonie, something
must be done about that will very soon.
When can you give me an hour to speak of
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lynde, why do you torture me with
that old question? You know that I will
never have anything to do with it. But there
is one thing that I wish you would do.
Where is the necessity for prosecuting that
poor man, Luis Kingsley? Surely losing all
his fortune is punishment enough for what he
has done."</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously a moment, and
said:</p>

<p>"But I must do it if that will is admitted to
probate. There is just one way that he can
be saved, and that is for you to make your
claim to the money, and prove it valid. Otherwise
he must suffer."</p>

<p>He knew that she was not sufficiently a
lawyer to know whether he was telling the
truth or not, and he also knew that, under
the circumstances, the point he had made was
a strong one.</p>

<p>She gazed at him a moment; then her lips
began to tremble, and her eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>She turned away from him hastily, but not
before he had seen, and the sight was too
much for him.</p>

<p>A man can never endure to see a woman in
tears, and most particularly not a woman
whom he loves.</p>

<p>One quick step forward, an extension of the
arms, and she was taken to his breast.</p>

<p>"I know that I am a criminal to tell you of
my love while that poor girl lies dead in that
dreadful place!" he exclaimed, contritely.
"But what am I to do? The temptation has
overpowered me. After all, she never loved
me, and she knew that I did not love her,
therefore the circumstances cannot be the
same. Leonie, darling, I do not ask if you
will be my wife, because I know you will!
You have never endeavored to conceal from
me that you love me, and through all the
wretched past that has been my single consolation.
Tell me that I have not been wrong,
sweetheart!"</p>

<p>She was weeping softly, but they were tears
of relief.</p>

<p>"Why did you wish to distress me about
the will when you knew that it would be
compromised in that way?" she asked, a little
smile rippling through the tears. "Oh,
Lynde, it has been such weary, hopeless waiting.
I cannot realize that there are really no
barriers between us now. There was a time
when I would rather have died than have you
know the shame that rested upon my mother's
name, but after all the fault was not hers,
and it would seem to me now that concealment
meant shame upon her memory. Tell
me that you do not despise me for it, dear?"</p>

<p>He laughed a little, holding her all the closer.</p>

<p>"Do I look as though I despised you for
anything, or could despise you for anything
under God's heaven?" he asked tenderly.
"My darling, you have come to me through
grief and suffering, but you are mine at last,
thank Heaven, and all the more precious because
of the waiting and the misery."</p>

<p>She lifted her face and allowed him to kiss
her after the weary restraint of months.</p>

<p>In that kiss, they seemed to live again
through the weary, hideous time that had intervened
since their meeting, and it was with
a thankfulness to God that neither of them
could have expressed that they realized it
was over and done with forever.</p>

<p>"If Dad could only know how happy I am
in spite of all the sorrow I have known!"
muttered Leonie. "Dear old Dad, if he could
only have lived to see his little girl as she is
now! But surely up there with God he
knows it all, and the joy with my mother is
as great as mine!"</p>

<p>She gazed up at her young, handsome lover
fondly.</p>

<p>"I hope we will not be punished for our
happiness, Lynde," she said slowly. "It seems
dreadful when one thinks of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hesitated, and he closed her lips with
a caress.</p>

<p>"There can be no wrong in the love that
God has given, my dearest!" he whispered.
"Why should we try to conceal what our
whole hearts are crying aloud?"</p>

<p>She made no attempt to answer him, but
allowed him to comfort her, now that the
long wait was ended.</p>

<p>She had made no move to leave when Mr.
Pryor entered.</p>

<p>"Have you two effected your compromise
yet?" he questioned dryly.</p>

<p>Leonie colored guiltily.</p>

<p>"We have, sir!" returned Lynde, with
manly quiet and dignity. "Under the circumstances
that exist, we wish the matter to
remain our secret for the present, or rather
that of the family. Perhaps we have been
premature, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense. You would have been foolish
not to have taken advantage of the opportunity
that God made for you especially. I
congratulate you both with all my heart. I
have never had anything make me happier,
and I am sure all the rest of the family will
join me."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is little remaining to be told.</p>

<p>Luis Kingsley was not prosecuted for the
felonious concealment of a will. He was released
from prison, and shortly after disappeared
from the country. No one knew where
he went, and presumably no one cared enough
to inquire. He was as utterly dead to Lynde
and Leonie as though the grave were between
them.</p>

<p>Ben Mauprat was sentenced to two years in
the penitentiary for assault with intent to kill,
with a charge of complicity in a robbery hanging
over his head upon his release. But the
chances are that he will never be prosecuted
upon that charge.</p>

<p>Leonie entered her claim to the estate simply
to prove the legality of her mother's marriage,
and won the case, against the man who
was to become her husband shortly afterward.</p>

<p>It occasioned considerable merriment
among Lynde's friends, but there were none
of them who did not envy him the "romance
of the thing," as they termed it.</p>

<p>They are very happy, Lynde and Leonie.
They are regular visitors at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Chandler, where Leonie is petted
and made much of, while the home of the
Pryors will be hers until after her nuptials
shall have been celebrated.</p>

<p>And so the story ends as does all life, with
the reward of virtue and the punishment of
vice.</p>

<p>"Every man's life is a fairy-tale written by
God's fingers."</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
